# Vessels

## About

Exploring using schema.org to describe research vessels.  Note that schema.org
is a very broad vocabulary and as such specific concepts like research vessel is
not well aligned.

One approach we can use, however, is to leverage schema.org a a discovery layer
and link more directly to detailed institutional metadata records.
