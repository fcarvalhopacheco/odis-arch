    <https://schema.org/description> "The Digital Asset Management (DAM) Workshop will give participants the opportunity to explore a wide array of topics typically associated with a DAM infrastructure. Topics relevant to content creation, asset management, and dissemination will be presented during the workshop.  Over the course of four days participants will have the opportunity to evaluate each topic area presented and develop a concept model based on the needs of the aquatic and marine science community.  Several case studies will be presented throughout the course and working in groups, participants will interact with others who have similar asset management needs.  Enterprise DAM is a very broad topic where infrastructure development in most cases requires careful assessment of the types of assets created, the ways in which they are used, and careful lifecycle management planning as these issues relate to the specific community of users.  Participants should leave the workshop with an understanding of the purpose and value of DAM, the core principles typically associated with this type of system, and have articulated a first-level assessment of DAM needs within the community by creating a conceptual diagram." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "To ensure food and job security, food production systems need to be innovated so that they protect the environment, mitigate climate change and become more climate-resilient. This is an opportunity for seaweed culture which captures nutrients and CO2, and does not need freshwater or fertilizers. In Ecuador, edible seaweed is being produced by small farmers, but a sustainable biomass valorization strategy is missing. Moreover, a good knowledge of the existing seaweed species is still lacking. This course offers an introduction to the diversity, taxonomy and biogeography of the seaweeds of the Tropical East Pacific (Ecuador), in the framework of the project Seaweed-based innovations for a resilient aquaculture and agriculture (SIRENA funded by VLIR-UOS).  Aims and Objectives  The course aims at familiarizing the participants with the morphological and functional diversity of seaweeds in an evolutionary framework based on the most recent (molecular-) phylogenetic insights. In addition, important ecological and biogeographical aspects of these groups, and their potential for applied research, will be addressed. Although not restricted to any specific geographic region, the course content will use case studies of the seaweed diversity of the Pacific South America.  Expected Learning Outcomes  At the end of the course, the participants will:    know the scientific terminology used in the fields of phycology.  recognize and know the most important groups of algae&nbsp;as well as their main biological (morphological) and ecological characteristics.  have an understanding of how the current concepts of the evolution of algae have changed mainly through the use of genetic data during the last decades.  understand the importance of algae and protists for the functioning of coastal ecosystems, and their potential for applied research (food &amp; feed, energy, biomolecules). &nbsp;    Target audience and prerequisites   This course is designed for researchers, students, professionals and/or policy makers working on and/or interested in seaweed.  The participants need to have a basic knowledge of marine sciences, biology and/ or aquaculture (BSc level) and proven experience working with seaweeds.  An intermediate level of Spanish and English (min. B1) is required.  Course Content    Introduction to the importance of a seaweed economy and the SIRENA project (SVDH)  The origin and spread of photosynthetic algae (ODC)  Diversity and ecology of red algae (ODC)  Diversity and ecology of green algae (FL)  Diversity and ecology of brow algae (ODC)  Seaweed identification and species concepts (FL, ODC)  An introduction to molecular systematics (FL)  How make an algarium (AM)  Seaweed examples from Ecuador (SVDH)    Language of Instruction  English and Spanish  Instructors  English speakers:    Peter Bossier, UGent, Belgium [PB]  Olivier De Clerck, UGent, Belgium [ODC]  Frederik Leliaert, Meise Botanical Garden &amp; UGent, Belgium [FL]  Sofie Van Den Hende, ESPOL, Ecuador [SVDH] and    Spanish speaker:    Adrian Marquez, ESPOL, Ecuador [AM]    &nbsp;  Learner Assessment  Learners will be assessed through quizzes and other exercises throughout the course. A course certificate will be issued to all participants who have attended all sessions and attained not less than 70% success in the assignments." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "The 4-day training will cover tsunami warning operations and the use of the PTWC Enhanced Products for tsunami threat decision-making. Topics will include warning and response standard operating procedures and challenges, warning decision support tools, evacuation concepts and planning, and awareness strategies. Over the last 10+ years, with improvements in data quality, quantity, and real-time availability, PTWC’s response time has dropped significantly from an hour to 5-10 minutes for tsunami events. At the same time, with each great earthquake and tsunami since 26 December 2004 helping to increase scientific understanding, better techniques have been developed to quickly characterize the earthquake and numerically model the tsunami. In 2014, the PTWC implemented Enhanced Products for the PTWS that now include wave amplitude forecasts in both text and graphical formats, and that require each country to explicitly assign Warning / Watch status for their own coasts. In July 2015, the First Pacific Ministerial Meeting on Meteorology adopted the Nuku'alofa Declaration, calling for support to ensure that National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) have the necessary capacity to support sustainable development, and specifically for the need to strengthen their tsunami early warning systems. Accordingly, the goal of this training is to increase the capacity of first responder operational staff to efficiently and effectively respond to tsunamis." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "Ocean colour analysis is a proven tool for determining the health of ocean using oceanic biological activity through optical means. Phytoplankton pigment, chlorophyll_a, are indicators of equilibrium of CO2 concentration between atmosphere and ocean. The oceanic colour change due to chlorophyll_a provides the level of primary productivity whereas the colour change due to CDOM can be attributed to the level of pollution and higher particulate matter. The ability of optical sensor to map the spatial and temporal patterns of ocean colour over regional and global scales has provided important insights into the fundamental bio-optical properties and bio-physical processes occurring in the aquatic media. Chlorophyll, SST and PAR can be operationally scaled up to estimate primary production and estimate the fish stocks. This training focus on basics of marine optics, ocean colour remote sensing, and its applications such as mapping primary productivity, phytoplankton classes and algal blooms.&nbsp;  Aims and Objectives    To Provide an introduction to Ocean Color Remote Sensing, Marine optics, Ocean colour sensor characteristics, data, uncertainties.

    <https://schema.org/description> "NOAA NWS operates the EMWIN program to provide a stream of information via NOAA GOES satellites and over the Internet. The stream provides the emergency management community with various warning and meteorological products in a timely and reliable manner.  One of the benefits of EMWIN is that it does not require a fee or ongoing cost to operate, and initial station equipment is inexpensive and easy to operate.  The EMWIN system is used throughout the United States and extensively in the Pacific region.  Through previous training workshops it has been deployed in the Caribbean, and we are aware of its use in parts of Central and South America.    A training workshop on the Emergency Managers Weather Information Network (EMWIN), tentatively scheduled for the week of February 20th, 2011 in Puerto Rico will involve Caribbean and Central American National Meteorological -- Hydrological Services, emergency management agencies, and related entities.  The call for this training was distributed to Tsunami Warning Focal Points and Tsunami National Contacts.  In association with the workshop, NOAA plans to deploy EMWIN stations throughout the Caribbean and Central America.  Support for this activity has been provided though an inter-agency agreement between the NOAA National Weather Service (NWS) and the US Agency for International Development (USAID) Office of US Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA)" ;

The language of trainings will be Spanish. Course materials will be in both Spanish and English.    TEMPP emphasizes a team approach for building country tsunami preparedness.    Each TEMPP training builds from the previous training, and it is assumed that once trained, participants will share the information learned on return to their country. A TEMPP country team should be comprised of, at a minimum, all participants to the TEMPP trainings. It should include scientists (responsible for tsunami hazard risk assessment and tsunami inundation modeling), GIS experts (responsible for making maps), emergency managers (responsible for tsunami public safety and preparedness), and tsunami warning center staff (responsible for issuing warnings for during events).    The TEMPP4 training, September 26-30, 2016, builds from the third training (TEMPP3, Tsunami Evacuation Mapping) and will teach the process for creating practical tsunami response plans for communities.  It is recommended that the TEMPP4 participant should be the person responsible for tsunami emergency response plans in the country.  Prior to attending, the TEMPP4 participant should meet with the TEMPP3 participant (and/or TEMPP Country Team) to obtain the tsunami evacuation map that will be used to create the evacuation procedures in the tsunami response plan." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "The Pacific Ocean and its adjacent seas is the largest, most diverse and most prone to tsunamis of all the Earth oceans. Pacific nations must be prepared to face the dangers of tsunami from distant, regional and local sources.    Over the last 10+ years, with improvements in data quality, quantity, and real-time availability, PTWC response time has dropped significantly from an hour to < 10 minutes for distant events.  At the same time, with each great earthquake and tsunami since 26 December 2004 helping to increase scientific understanding, better techniques have been developed to quickly characterize the earthquake and numerically model the tsunami.  This in turn has led to significant improvements in a warning center ability to accurately forecast coastal wave height and impact, and an ability to provide timely advice to support local tsunami warning decision-making.    At its 25th session of the Intergovernmental Coordination Group for the Pacific Ocean Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System (ICG/PTWS), Vladivostok, Russian Federation, 9-11 September 2013, Member States approved the start of the PTWC Enhanced Products on October 1, 2014.  These products, the first large-scale modifications in decades, fundamentally change the way in which countries assess their national tsunami threats.  The PTWC will cease providing Warnings and Watches, and instead issue tsunami wave forecasts.  Public text products will continue to be issued, but the additional graphical and statistical products will only be sent to designated PTWS Tsunami Warning Focal Points.     This 3-day training will cover the explanation and use of the PTWC New Enhanced Tsunami Forecast Products by National Tsunami Warning Centers and Emergency Response Agencies.  Topics will cover the end-to-end warning process, warning center and emergency response standard operating procedures and their challenges, advanced topics in warning operations, and the methodologies, limitations, and interpretation of the PTWC Enhanced Products." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "Overview The training course Marine Species Distribution modeling covers the background knowledge on marine biogeography, and the technical aspects needed to develop Species Distribution Models. Students will be trained in the basics of statistical modeling and guided through the modeling phases: compile distribution data from open access databases (e.g. OBIS) and environmental information from publically available ecological data layers using Geographic Information Systems, make informed decisions on parameter settings and select the best methods for developing distribution models, forecast distributions under different Climate Change scenarios, validate models and incorporate results in scientific manuscripts and technical reports. The course includes theoretical lectures and hands-on exercises using predominantly case studies of marine macroalgae. Students are encouraged to bring their own datasets. Learning Outcomes Understand distributions of marine organism and predict shifts in response to Climate Change. Develop skills for taking the best decisions and applying the correct statistical tools needed for Species Distribution Modeling (SDM). Being able to discuss the results of SDM into scientific manuscripts and technical reports, and defend them to a wide audience. Understand the strengths and limitations when applying SDM to real cases. Recognize the importance of good practice in Species Distribution Modeling Course Topics Marine biogeographical distributions and niche modeling. Niche concepts: what niche is being modeled? Basis of Statistical Distribution Modeling. Definition of correlative and mechanistic SDMs. Desired properties, modeling phases &amp; decisions, the recipe. Introduction to GIS and distribution data mining. Modeling methods (e.g. Bioclim, GLM, Maxent, boosted tree regression) Equilibrium assumption, transferability and forecasting.

    <https://schema.org/description> "Overview:  Ocean acidification – the unprecedented decline in the ocean’s pH as a result of carbon dioxide emissions – poses significant threats to ecosystems and economies in the Latin America and Caribbean region. Despite this threat, there are significant gaps in our understanding of current ocean chemistry conditions in the region. The purpose of this workshop is to provide advanced, hands-on training to enable the development of new monitoring stations in the Latin America and Caribbean region in order to fill these gaps.   This workshop is part of a series of capacity building trainings organized by The Ocean Foundation and its partners, including The Global Ocean Acidification Observing Network (GOA-ON), the International Atomic Energy Agency’s Ocean Acidification International Coordination Centre (IAEA OA-ICC), and supported by multiple funding partners, including the U.S. Department of State and the Swedish International Development Agency. This regional workshop is co-organized by the Latin America Ocean Acidification Network (LAOCA Network).  The training will focus on the use of the GOA-ON in a Box monitoring kit – a suite of equipment developed by Drs. Christopher Sabine and Andrew Dickson, The Ocean Foundation, The IAEA OA-ICC, GOA-ON, and Sunburst Sensors.  This kit provides all hardware (sensors, lab-ware) and software (QC programs, SOPs) required to collect weather-quality carbonate chemistry data. Specifically, the kit includes:       Sunburst Sensor’s iSAMI pH sensor  Bottle sample and preservation materials for the collection of discreet samples  A manual titration set up for determination of the alkalinity of discreet samples  A spectrophotometer for manual determination of pH of discreet samples  A computer loaded with sensor and QC software and SOPs  Ad hoc equipment to support the collection and analysis of samples on an institution-by-institution basis       Workshop participants will spend the week mastering the equipment and techniques included in the GOA-ON in a Box kit. Participants will also have the opportunity to learn about additional techniques and instruments that are available at the host institution, INVEMAR." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "The TEMPP training course is intended to be a standardized course and process for the  production of reliable and practical community-level tsunami evacuation maps. The direct  outcomes are communities that know what to do and where to go when a tsunami warning is  issued, or when self-responding to the natural warning signs of a tsunami. Upon completion,  countries should have the capability and tools to replicate the community evacuation map  process elsewhere in their country.    This training focuses on TEMPP Module 1 and will equip participants with knowledge to  develop an inundation map, with or without the use of modelling. A tsunami inundation map  identifies areas expected to be flooded by tsunamis based on available historical evidence  and/or modelling, and is essential to developing an evacuation plan and undertaking  mitigation measures to minimize the impact of tsunami.  TEMPP1 covers the explanation and use of inundation models for evacuation modeling.  Topics include earthquake tectonics, tsunami science, bathymetric and topographic grids,  earthquake source parameters, forecast methodology, tsunami modeling, tsunami hazard  assessment and use of the MOST model and ComMIT interface tool." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "Satellite data are particularly powerful when combined with data from other sources, such as in situ measurements or geographic or socio-economic information, whilst Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are a powerful tool for bringing together different types of geo-referenced data, including satellite images.  This training course highlights the technologies used to measure Sea Surface Temperature and phytoplankton proxy data, as well as the main applications of these data such as primary production, fronts and time series variations. Participants will gain hands-on experience with image analysis software to visualize and interpret the data in different contexts. Participants will get a brief introduction to some of the ways in which data from these different sources may be visualized and brought together to give more complete information needed to support decision makers in marine management and policy development. Training will primarily be based on BILKO 3.4 and QGIS.  Aims and Objectives    To provide an introduction to GIS for marine applications  Utilization of open source spatial data  To provide hands on GIS applications&nbsp;for marine environment    Learning Outcomes    Increased awareness of the data sources in support of management of oceans  Improved skills on processing of Remote Sensing data  Enhanced skills on use of commonly and freely available software tools for GIS and Remote sensing  Increased sharing of knowledge and skills through presentation of small projects developed and presented on the last day of the workshop    Target Audience  Marine researchers, PhD students, public officers with a University degree on marine related sciences.

In event time, the topics include event monitoring and detection, threat evaluation and warning, alert dissemination, emergency response, evacuation, and public action. An effective tsunami warning system is achieved when all people in vulnerable coastal communities are prepared to respond appropriately and in a timely manner upon recognizing that a potential destructive tsunami may be approaching. Meeting this challenge requires round the-clock monitoring with real-time data streams and rapid alerting, as well as prepared communities, a strong emergency management system, and close and effective cooperation between all stakeholders. Stakeholders must be able to work in coordination and with good understanding of each other’s roles, responsibilities, authorities, procedures, and action during a tsunami event. Planning and preparedness, and practicing in advance of the real event, are important to familiarize agency staff with the steps and decision-making that will need to be carried out without hesitation in a real emergency." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "Summary The collection and organization of data is an integral and critical part of a research process. Management of research data is a service area of increasing interest to researchers and data managers. It covers the planning, creating, storing, organizing, accessing, sharing, describing, publishing and curating of data. Most public funded research have listed data as a key deliverable hence the need for skills on how to access, preserve and archive data. Marine information managers are increasingly seen as major contributors to RDM activities in general and in the design of research data services (RDS) in particular. They promote research by providing services for storage, discovery and access, liaise and partner with researchers and data centers to foster an inter-operable infrastructure for the above services. Most information managers are looking for opportunities to develop their RDM related skills. This training recognizes the potential that librarians/ information managers can offer and hence the need to develop their skills in research data management process. Course Objectives The course will provide comprehensive training in research data management in order to lay the foundations for a common approach for research data management amongst researchers, repositories and facilities (including libraries) that manage marine data, thereby helping to ensure that the data is accessible, standardized and maintained over time. Learning outcomes &bull; Understand the importance of maintaining integrity (accuracy and completeness) of data. &bull; Develop skills in writing and implementing a Data Management Plan, including those associated with Funding agency requirements and mandates &bull; Gain knowledge of the terminology of Open Access and Open Data as it applies to Research Data Management &bull; Advance knowledge in the current landscape of Research Data Management, and internationally organized efforts to develop standards and tools in this field &bull; Recognize the importance of good research data management practice" ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "The Caribbean and its adjacent seas, including the Atlantic, have been the source region for 11 % of the world’s fatal tsunamis over history, with almost 100 tsunamis observed that have impacted 23 countries of this region.  Caribbean nations must be prepared to face the dangers of tsunami from distant, regional and local sources. While many Caribbean Member countries continue to depend primarily on the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) for the warning advice to their National Tsunami Warning Centres, the reality of the dangers posed by local and regional sources does require Member States to: (i) identify and assess their tsunami risk; (ii) improve and expand the capabilities of their National Tsunami Warning Centres (NTWC)/Tsunami Warning Focal Points (TWFP) and Disaster Management Offices (NDMO) in order to respond to a tsunami in a timely and responsible manner to save lives; and (iii) engage in regional collaboration to build a strong warning and mitigation system.    In this context, the International Tsunami Information Center (Hawaii), in collaboration with the IOC ICG/CARIBE-EWS Secretariat, the Caribbean Tsunami Information Center (CTIC), and the Caribbean Tsunami Warning Program (CTWP) organise a Regional Tsunami Training Workshop on Strengthening Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Tsunami Warning and Emergency Response and the Development of the ICG/CARIBE-EWS PTWC New Enhanced Products to be held at the La Romana Dreams Hotel in Bayahibe, Dominican Republic, 4-8 November 2013.  The training has the support of UNESCO and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for Barbados and the OECS through the Enhancing Resilience to Reduce Vulnerability in the Caribbean (ERC) Project.  Participants are: a) members of the country’s national tsunami warning centre/tsunami warning focal point, national disaster management office, or geohazards agency; and b) responsible for and involved in tsunami warning and emergency response operations, and/or responsible for their country's Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs).  Participipating countries for this session are: Antigua and Barbuda, Bahamas, Dominican Republic, Haiti, St Kitts and Nevis, Sint Maarten, UK (Anguilla, Bermuda, British Virgin Islands, Turk and Caicos), USA." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "Overview Upwelling is an oceanographic feature that is very important to the ocean ecosystem. It brings high nutrient water to the surface and the impact is noteworthy to the ocean productivity. This nutrient-rich water will encourage a phytoplankton bloom that is ultimate base for large animal population in the food chains, including fish, mammals and sea birds. Although this coastal upwelling regions covers relatively small areas of the ocean surface, they contribute roughly 50 percent of the world’s fisheries landings. We believe it is important to put special attention in providing specific tools and skills in understanding upwelling dynamics. Upwelling dynamics holds a very important value that require special skills, but the nature of the study is rather straightforward and can be done using many available data such as satellite, World Ocean Database and re-analysis of wind data. Thus, the training will hopefully can become very important initiatives to allow exploration at any particular upwelling site. Objectives: • To explore existing upwelling site using available datasets and increase understanding of the physical-biological interaction dynamics of upwelling regions • To construct integrated data gathering which involve field data, satellite data and wind-data at any particular upwelling site • To conduct simple analysis from the integrated data in determining special characteristic of any particular upwelling site Target Audience: The targeted audiences include, but are not limited to, the following: • Marine and coastal scientists • Oceanographic data managers • Academic professors • Government officers • Environmental scientists with knowledge of essential marine parameters • Students in the oceanographic or meteorological sciences Pre-requisites: Participants should have • Educational backgrounds in oceanographic sciences • Proficiency to use personal computers with Windows or Mac • The working knowledge of English • Preferably user with skills of Matlab or ArcGIS" ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "1.Aims    This training course seeks to bring together marine researchers, data/document managers and marine data librarians to develop an agreed approach to sound data management for all research activities conducted as part of the second International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE-2).   The second International Indian Ocean Expedition (IIOE-2) is a major new program of the IOC in partnership with the Indian Ocean Global Ocean Observing System (IOGOOS) Regional Alliance and the Scientific Committee for Oceanographic Research (SCOR). Over the next 5 years, a large number of IIOE-2 related research activities will collect new data on a range of physical, biogeochemical, biological and coupled climatic characteristics of the Indian Ocean. Many IORA Member States are anticipated to lead research activities under IIOE-2, or will be part of international collaborations undertaking oceanographic research. For more information on IIOE-2, refer to www.iioe-2.incois.gov.in/. Basic scientific research requires sound data management practices and one of the overarching objectives of IIOE-2 will be to support the collection and curation all data to encourage data sharing using internationally agreed rules of data exchange, and to facilitate data discovery and use in the long term.  This course, Research Data Management (RDM), will cover the planning, creating, storing, organizing, accessing, sharing, describing, publishing and curating of data in the context of IIOE-2 and its data and information management objectives. The course content has broad applicability in the field of research data management in general.    2.Objectives  The course will provide comprehensive training in research data management in order to lay the foundations for a common approach for research data management amongst researchers, repositories and facilities (inc. libraries) that manage marine data in IORA Member States, thereby helping to ensure that the data is accessible, standardized and maintained over time. There are 4 strategic objectives for the training course:  a) Strengthen regional cooperation between IORA Member States in oceanographic research and data management through the development of a common framework for research data management under IIOE-2 to facilitate increased accessibility and sharing of research data  b) Build relationships between IORA Member States and other nations engaged in IIOE-2 research activities to improve their own national capacity in areas of mutual research and data management interests   c) Advance the knowledge of IORA Member States in current international best practice in research data management standards and tools  d) Promote women’s participation in research data management activities.

The language of trainings will be Spanish.  Course materials will be in both Spanish and English.    TEMPP emphasizes a team approach for building country tsunami preparedness.    Each TEMPP training builds from the previous training, and it is assumed that once trained, participants will share the information learned on return to their country.  A TEMPP country team should be comprised of, at a minimum, all participants to the TEMPP trainings.  It should include scientists (responsible for tsunami hazard risk assessment and tsunami inundation modeling), GIS experts (responsible for making maps), emergency managers (responsible for tsunami public safety and preparedness), and tsunami warning center staff (responsible for issuing warnings for during events).    The TEMPP3 training, August 15-18, 2016, will builds from the second training (TEMPP2, Tsunami Inundation Mapping), and will teach the process for creating reliable tsunami evacuation maps for communities. It is recommended that the TEMPP3 participant have experience in the use of Graphical User Information tools (especially QGIS software) to make maps, and/or should be the person responsible for the development of tsunami evacuation maps in the country.  Prior to attending, the TEMPP3 participant should meet with the TEMPP1 and TEMPP2 participant(s) to receive the tsunami inundation map that will be used to create the tsunami evacuation map.    " ;

The language of trainings will be Spanish. Course materials will be in both Spanish and English.     TEMPP emphasizes a team approach for building country tsunami preparedness.    Each TEMPP training builds from the previous training, and it is assumed that once trained, participants will share the information learned on return to their country. A TEMPP country team should be comprised of, at a minimum, all participants to the TEMPP trainings. It should include scientists (responsible for tsunami hazard risk assessment and tsunami inundation modeling), GIS experts (responsible for making maps), emergency managers (responsible for tsunami public safety and preparedness), and tsunami warning center staff (responsible for issuing warnings for during events).    The TEMPP5 training, February 15-17, 2017, will builds from the fourth training (TEMPP4, Tsunami Response Plans and Exercises), and will put in practice a tsunami drill for the community of Cedeño including evacuation. It is recommended that the TEMPP5 participant should be the person responsible for tsunami public safety and preparedness in the country, has experience in emergency management responses and if possible, having attended for TEMPP4.

    <https://schema.org/description> "Overview    The concept of quality management has become increasingly significant for many National Oceanographic Data Centres to meet national and international competency standards for delivery of data products and services. The IODE is developing a Quality Management Framework for NODCs that includes the implementation of technical standards and quality management systems which will lead to the accreditation of NODCs.     This training workshop provides an introduction for NODCs and ADUs involved in the development, implementation and management of a Quality Management System which will assist in the adoption of comprehensive management practices and increased confidence in the quality of their data, products and services.    Aims and Objectives  - To introduce the IODE Quality Management Framework  - To describe the importance of quality for oceanographic data  - To introduce the ISO 9000 series of standards  - To provide a description of a Quality Management System  - To discuss the requirements of a quality manual   - To describe accreditation process for NODCs    This is a practical workshop. The participants will work in teams to complete workshop exercises on each topic to reinforce learning and understanding of the requirements for a quality management system and the IODE accreditation for NODCs.    Target Audience  - Course participation is restricted to representatives of NODCs and ADUs.     Applicants must include an endorsement letter from their institution stating their commitment to work towards IODE accreditation of their data centre.

    <https://schema.org/description> "The APC, initiated in the 1970s at the University of Oslo with the support of UNESCO and its Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission, has been held from 1985 to 2015 at the Stazione Zoologica of Naples and in 2012 at the University of Copenhagen. APC12 will be the first edition held in France. The course is open to 20 selected researchers, technical staff, and/or PhD/postdoctoral students from around the world who already have expertise in taxonomy of marine phytoplankton and routinely need to identify it in a professional context. The aim is to provide participants with updated and in-depth high-level theoretical and practical training on how to identify and classify members of the major marine phytoplankton groups (diatoms, dinoflagellates, coccolithophores and other phytoflagellates), including species responsible for the formation of exceptional or harmful algal blooms.  The 20-day program consists of lectures and practical sessions during which participants will receive training in classical techniques (such as light and electron microscopy) as well as integration of new approaches (such as flow cytometry and molecular genetics) into the study of microalgae. The faculty of APC12 includes an international team of leading experts in the taxonomy of different groups of marine phytoplankton. Over the last 4 decades the APC has made an outstanding contribution to disseminating the vast body of highly specialist knowledge on phytoplankton taxonomy, which is almost completely overlooked in mainstream educational curricula in spite of its renovated importance, e.g. for interpreting data produced by modern high-throughput methods. Many of the international scientists trained during previous APC editions have gone on to apply, develop and spread the knowledge gained during the course in their local regions.  &nbsp;" ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "About the Course:    Operational oceanography involves reliable, long term observations of the world's oceans, rapid interpretation and dissemination of data and generation of products and advisories that can be distributed to users in near real time. The recent advances made in observational technologies in the fields of sensors, platforms and real-time communications now provide unpr ecedented capability to observe the oceans in detail. Scientists worldwide are working towards the establishment of a comprehensive network of observational instruments that will criss-cross the world's oceans. Data from such ocean observation systems are delivered both in real-time and delayed mode to the scientific community. These data are extensively used in operational weather, ocean and climate forecasting. These systems provide critical data for assimilation in ocean analysis and forecast models. The new knowledge acquired from these observing systems has led to improved understanding of different phenomena and processes of the global tropical ocean basins, particularly of the Indian ocean-monsoon coupled system. With evolving technological developments, we have new challenges and opportunities for the ocean community. However, it is necessary to enhance the capacity of some of the countries to make the much required ocean observations and train personnel to use the data from them.    The training programme will address these issues for the capacity building of the countries in the Indian Ocean region, leading to better utilization of the high quality data sets and better services to the people in this region.    Course Objectives :    The lectures will cover the following broad topics:        An overview of recent advances in ocean observations, data sets and applications      Fundamentals of time series analysis techniques (Filters in time and space, Fourier analysis, Confidence tests, EOF)      An overview of ocean models and data sets, quality assessment of operational ocean forecasts      Hands-on exercises on analysis of data" ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "Overview    Over the past decade, we have become increasingly defined as a global culture of content creators. Libraries have and continue to adapt their services to meet the needs of a changing information ecosystem. Digital information in the form of data, video, audio, text, graphics, as well as complex objects such as web sites, are being created, published, repurposed, and stored. These activities are occurring at a rapid pace and on a massive scale, largely due to the increasing availability of technology that is allowing for greater participation by larger communities of users. Within the oceanographic community, libraries are providing support for scientist in a variety of ways (e.g.: Cruise Summary Reports and dataset linking; cruise video editing, access and archiving and image management).    Digital Asset Management (DAM) provides a methodical approach to ingest, cataloguing, storage, retrieval, distribution, and disposal of content in digital form.  This course is designed to assist participants in identifying digital assets, evaluate institutional resources available to support the management of digital assets, the identification of resource deficiencies, and finally preparation of an implementation plan that will begin to address DAM support for the institution. One day will be devoted to Digital Asset Management Basics. Sharing and feedback from peers will provide an opportunity to fine tune the DAM plans elaborated by the participants, which would allow multiple institutions to leverage resources and expertise for the benefit of the group. This exercise will seek to identify collaborative service model opportunities among participating institutions. One of the primary objectives of this course is to provide students with an implementation plan based on current capabilities. The post assessment survey will seek to identify areas of success as well as any obstacles encountered.     Target Audience  - Information Managers  - Marine Librarians    Topics to be included:  - Introduction and DAM Overview  - Dataset linking   - Cruise video  - Institutional Assessment of DAM  - Resource Inventory  - Identifying Resource Deficiencies  - Writing the Implementation Plan  - Multi-institutional Resource Map  - Post-Assessment    Course Prerequisites:  Good command of the English language    A Certificate of Participation will be issued to all successful students." ;

Topics to be covered include: the role of a librarian in a marine science institution, information sources for marine science and coastal management, marketing and publicity for libraries, and development of library catalogues and databases.     Training will also be provided on the use of two library softwares (AgriOcean/DSpace and ABCD). DSpace provides the basic functionalities that are required by small libraries, such as cataloguing, while ABCD is fully-fledged integrated library management software.    The workshop will also provide the opportunity to finalize marine information management activities to be implemented by all the institutions participating in the current phase of ODINAFRICA." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "The Marine Institute, Ireland in collaboration with the IOC Science and Communication Centre for Harmful Algae, Denmark will conduct a proficiency test on marine phytoplankton abundance and composition amongst laboratories.   The intercomparison and proficiency test is open for participation for all relevant laboratories globally.  This test will be broken down into two main areas and each participant will be asked to return results for each.   The two areas are:  Identification – in the form of a “Taxonomic Quiz”, This test will be set up on the OceanTeacher e-Learning Platform. Participants will need to log on with a username and password and answer the questions online.   Enumeration and identification – a number of preserved seawater samples spiked with phytoplankton cultured material or/and natural field samples will be sent to each laboratory. The number and type of samples has not been decided yet and will be adapted to be relevant to the participants.  This year, we were planning on introducing Biovolume measurements  as a measure of biomass in the samples to complement the measurements we already take on abundance and composition of marine microalgae in the samples, but first we would like to ask the potential participants whether this new measurement is something their laboratory would be interested in doing and whether it is relevant to their activities.     Programme Schedule  Friday, 5th May 2017 Deadline for Registration  Tuesday, 2nd June 2017 Samples sent to analysts  Friday, 14th July 2017 Deadline for submission of  results to lead laboratory  October-December 2017 Intercalibration Report  (December 2017) and Workshop  (October-November 2017)      Registration Package   The fee for the proficiency test is 600 Euros per participant  This fee covers sample preparation, verification, packing and shipping. Preparation of an online taxonomy HABs quiz. Intercomparison study design, transfer and data analysis of results, statistical analysis, overall data processing, preparation of a final report and a statement of performance certificate.  Once registration has closed, participants will receive:  Samples couriered to individual analysts in each laboratory  A Phytoplankton taxonomy quiz in ‘OceanTeacher e-Learning Platform’ will be accessed online  Relevant set of protocols and instructions  Electronic summary report of laboratories performance in the intercomparison exercise  Confidential statement of performance certificate  Invitation to a training/wash-up workshop where participants will be presented with a draft report and have the opportunity to share experiences, discuss general results and make suggestions for future work. The workshop will have a practical element and guest speakers are invited to present their work during these sessions.    Course materials at the workshop  Please note that registration does not cover flights to and from the workshop, accommodation or meals during the workshop  Registration and Payment   If you wish to register for this intercomparison exercise, then you must contact our administrator in the Marine Institute finola.bradley@marine.ie      The administrator will need your laboratory name and address, number of analysts, Analysts’ full name and e-mail addresses.     The Marine Institute will invoice the participating laboratories within a month of registration.     Payment can be made by bank transfer, bank draft or cheque. Please ensure that your payment includes all bank charges incurred for transferring fees. The Marine Institute will not be liable for these charges and will aim to recover costs incurred from participants." ;

Topics will include warning and response SOPs and challenges, warning decision support tools, warning messages and alerting, evacuation concepts and planning, and awareness strategies. Over the last 10+ years, with improvements in data quality, quantity, and real-time availability, PTWC’s response time has dropped significantly from an hour to 5-10 minutes for tsunami events. At the same time, with each great earthquake and tsunami since 26 December 2004 helping to increase scientific understanding, better techniques have been developed to quickly characterize the earthquake and numerically model the tsunami. In 2014, the PTWC implemented Enhanced Products for the PTWS that now include wave amplitude forecasts in both text and graphical formats, and that require each country to explicitly assign Warning / Watch status in their own messages to their coasts. In 2016, the PTWC will implement its Enhanced Products for CARIBE-EWS countries." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "The Caribbean and its adjacent seas, including the Atlantic, have been the source region for 11 % of the world’s fatal tsunamis over history, with almost 100 tsunamis observed that have impacted 23 countries of this region. Caribbean nations must be prepared to face the dangers of tsunami from distant, regional and local sources. While many Caribbean Member countries continue to depend primarily on the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) for the warning advice to their National Tsunami Warning Centres, the reality of the dangers posed by local and regional sources does require Member States to: (i) identify and assess their tsunami risk; (ii) improve and expand the capabilities of their National Tsunami Warning Centres (NTWC)/Tsunami Warning Focal Points (TWFP) and Disaster Management Offices (NDMO) in order to respond to a tsunami in a timely and responsible manner to save lives; and (iii) engage in regional collaboration to build a strong warning and mitigation system.  In this context, the International Tsunami Information Center (Hawaii), in collaboration with the IOC ICG/CARIBE-EWS Secretariat, the Caribbean Tsunami Information Center (CTIC), and the Caribbean Tsunami Warning Program (CTWP) organise a Regional Tsunami Training Workshop on Strengthening Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Tsunami Warning and Emergency Response and the Development of the ICG/CARIBE-EWS PTWC New Enhanced Products to be held in Bridgetown, Barbados,18-22 November 2013. The training has the support of UNESCO and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) for Barbados and the OECS through the Enhancing Resilience to Reduce Vulnerability in the Caribbean (ERC) Project.  Participants are: a) members of the country’s national tsunami warning centre/tsunami warning focal point, national disaster management office, or geohazards agency; and b) responsible for and involved in tsunami warning and emergency response operations, and/or responsible for their country's Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). Participipating countries for this session are: Aruba, Barbados, Curaçao, Dominica, France (Guadeloupe, Martinique), Grenada, Guyana, Netherlands (Bonaire), St Lucia, St Vincent and The Grenadines, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, and Venezuela." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "The climate community is still faced with large uncertainties in estimating possible climate changes in the coming decades and quantifying the relative role of anthropogenic contribution to climate change. Although most modern climate models are able to reproduce reasonably well global climatologies and patterns of interannual variation, they still struggle with pervasive biases and the representation of some climate phenomena involving the interaction and coupling between the atmosphere, ocean, and marine biogeochemistry. The problem is compounded by limited understanding of some of the physical mechanisms and physical-biological interactions.  Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems (EBUSs) are areas of important biological productivity and large fluxes of energy and matter in the atmosphere, in the&nbsp;ocean and between the two. However, their future responses to intense anthropogenic pressure is uncertain. This research school aims at summarizing the current state of scientific understanding of EBUSs, including both observational and theoretical aspects of their coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics and of their marine biogeochemistry. In particular, while recent regional modelling efforts have shown that it is possible to simulate the ocean-atmosphere dynamics of upwelling, EBUSs remain poorly represented in climate models, and improved observations and theoretical understanding of the main physical and biogeochemical processes that link planetary and basin scales with regional scales are required in order to model the responses and interactions of EBUSs with large-scale forcing.  The&nbsp;ICTP-CLIVAR Summer School on &ldquo;Eastern Boundary Upwelling Systems: Assessing and understanding their changes and predicting their future&rdquo; will be jointly organised&nbsp;by the&nbsp;International Centre for Theoretical Physics (ICTP)&nbsp;and the CLIVAR Eastern Boundary Upwelling System Research Foci,&nbsp;from 15-21 July 2019, in Trieste, Italy.&nbsp;This school will focus on coupled ocean-atmosphere dynamics in upwelling systems, their biogeochemical and ecological processes, and their sensitivity to climate variability and change. Afternoons will be devoted to practical sessions involving the use of circulation models, analyses of relevant data sets, and discussion of current research." ;

These recommendations led IOC-UNESCO to coordinate with ORSNET secretariat, Vanuatu Meteorology and Geohazard Department (VMGD) in engaging The Pacific Community (SPC) Pacific Resilience Program (PREP) project to support one participant from each ORSNET member states to attend the Basic SeisComp Training delivered online by Gempa. The objective of the SPC PREP project is to strengthen early warning, resilient investments and financial protection of participating countries. SPC PREP project support towards this Online Basic SeisComp Training strengthens early warning for earthquakes and tsunami in the Southwest Pacific.

    <https://schema.org/description> "The ITIC Training Program on Tsunami Early Warning and Mitigation Systems has focused since 2005 on improving operating procedures for tsunami response as essential for successful tsunami warning. While infrequent, tsunamis can be extremely deadly because of their quick onset and immediate impact in minutes. In order to warn quickly and have the public evacuate when necessary, agencies must pre-plan and have protocols and procedures which are well-known to every stakeholder and to the public, and which are well-exercised and practiced. Communities must know their hazard and risk, and prepare in advance, so that every person can recognize the tsunami danger and know what to do to save their lives.  Over the last 15+ years, with improvements in data quality, quantity, and real-time availability, PTWC’s response time has dropped significantly from an hour to 5-7 minutes for tsunami events. Scientific understanding has increased and better techniques have been developed to quickly characterize the earthquake and numerically model the tsunami. In 2014, the PTWC implemented Enhanced Products that include wave forecasts in both text and graphical formats, and that require each country to explicitly assign Warning / Watch status in their own messages to their coasts. In 2019, the Japan Northwest Pacific Tsunami Advisory Center expanded its coverage to include Papua New Guinea and upgraded its services to include enhanced graphical products. Since 2017, UNESCO IOC has piloted Tsunami Ready, a performance-based Community Recognition Program, providing countries in the Pacific a tool to improve the readiness of coastal communities.  The training will focus on the end-to-end tsunami warning and emergency response chain, focusing on the importance of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for enabling consistent and rapid tsunami warning and response. SOP development is a dynamic process, and each event is unique in its generation and impact, and so also in its response. In every event and with every tsunami exercise, we improve our response and learn a little more about the science of tsunamis and how to better mitigate against their impact. At the local level, communities recognized as Tsunami Ready by UNESCO IOC have prepared beforehand by identifying their hazard and risk, developing evacuation maps, conducting regular exercises to practice their plans, sponsoring multiple education and awareness events, and installing reliable methods to receive and issue warnings." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "Increased activity in the coastal and marine environment has led to two important types of conflicts in the region: (1) conflicts among human uses (user-user conflicts); and (2) conflicts between human uses and the coastal and marine environment (user-environment conflicts). These conflicts weaken the ability of the ocean to provide the necessary ecosystem services upon which humans and all other life depend on. This course provides an introductory, but comprehensive, overview of CMSP. It focuses on describing a logical sequence of all the steps required to achieve desired goals and objectives for coastal and marine areas. This course does not focus on the technical details of any one of the steps and it is not intended to be a course that will help to develop a marine GIS or implement a performance monitoring system. When available, references to existing technical guides, handbooks, and websites are suggested in the course materials. This course can help professionals at the international, regional, national, and sub-national levels who want to know more about the promise and potential of CMSP as a way to achieve multiple goals and objectives, including sustainable economic development and biodiversity conservation within a specified coastal and marine area.  Learning Outcomes  The purpose of this course is to explain how CMSP can be used to implement ecosystem-based management. This course fills this gap by using a step-by-step approach for developing and implementing CMSP. It also discusses issues such as obtaining financial resources and including key&nbsp; stakeholders that are often neglected, and steps of the CMSP process.  Course Topics  &bull;What is CMSP, what are the benefits and expected results;  &bull;Insight in the logical steps and tasks of setting up a successful CMSP program;  &bull;Overview of successful and not successful case studies from around the world;  &bull;Identification of human activities that adversely affect important natural areas on coastal and marine areas  &bull;Streamlining the policies and licensing procedures affecting the coastal and marine environment  &bull;Identification of space most suitable for the development of new human activities such as renewable energy facilities or offshore aquaculture  Target Audience  &bull;National, state and local district planning officers responsible for the planning and management of coastal and marine areas, and their resources  &bull;Conservation personnel from the public and private sectors including NGOs  &bull;Decision makers; Local district / municipal officers  NOTE: priority will be given to participants originating from the South-East Asia Region. UNESCO is committed to promote gender equality. Therefore, applications from women are strongly encouraged.  Course Pre-requisites:  &bull;Interest or new responsibilities coastal zone management and marine spatial planning  &bull;Good Working knowledge of English language  &bull;Computer IT skills  A Certificate of Participation will be issued to all successful students." ;

In event time, the topics include event monitoring and detection, threat evaluation and warning, alert dissemination, emergency response, evacuation, and public action. An effective tsunami warning system is achieved when all people in vulnerable coastal communities are prepared to respond appropriately and in a timely manner upon recognizing that a potential destructive tsunami may be approaching. Meeting this challenge requires round the-clock monitoring with real-time data streams and rapid alerting, as well as prepared communities, a strong emergency management system, and close and effective cooperation between all stakeholders. Stakeholders must be able to work in coordination and with good understanding of each otherâ??s roles, responsibilities, authorities, procedures, and action during a tsunami event. Planning and preparedness, and practicing in advance of the real event, are important to familiarize agency staff with the steps and decision-making that will need to be carried out without hesitation in a real emergency." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "This course is designed to give guidance on bringing together measurements from disparate field studies and projects to preserve the data for future use and easy dissemination to researchers and the public. There are worldwide subsurface ocean observing systems such as the Argo project of autonomous profiling floats and the Ship of Opportunity Program which facilitates the deployment of Expendable Bathythermographs (XBTs) along merchant shipping lines. But many oceanographic field studies are more localized, from a mooring at a single coastal site to fisheries research cruises within a country&rsquo;s coastal waters to trans basin lines such as the long running time series at 24&reg;N in the Atlantic Ocean used to monitor the Atlantic Overturning Circulation. Locally, nationally, regionally, and globally, an important task is to bring together these measurements in their different forms, with different crucial metadata, from different instrumentation, from different field projects so the data can be used to understand ocean and climate beyond the original scope of the various projects. The first day of the course will be concerned with the mechanics and data base skills necessary to bring together data at levels beyond a single cruise or mooring and serve them to the researchers and the public In a way that can be easily utilized, with sufficient information for a researcher 50 years in the future to still understand." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "The ITP -2019 training will be conducted by the International Tsunami Information Center (ITIC), in collaboration with the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and technical and emergency management partners in Hawaii (USA). The ITP-Hawaii will demonstrate a working example of an end-to-end tsunami warning and mitigation system centered in Hawaii, with PTWC as its local tsunami warning centre. ITIC is hosted by the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service (SHOA) Chile in partnership with the IOC of UNESCO.  Over the last 15+ years, by improving data quality, quantity, and numerical methods, PTWC’s response time has dropped significantly from one hour to within 5–7 minutes of the earthquake. Since 2014 for the Pacific, and 2016 for the Caribbean region, PTWC has also issued enhanced products that include forecasts of the expected coastal impact of tsunamis for each country.  In 2019, the Japan’s Northwest Pacific Tsunami Advisory Center (NWPTAC) upgraded its products to include graphical forecasts, and China’s South China Sea Tsunami Advisory Center (SCSTAC) is issuing graphical forecast products in experimental mode.  In this respect, it is worth reminding that globally 90% of the casualties caused by tsunamis (99% in the Pacific) have resulted from local tsunamis that attacked in a few minutes, leaving no time for preparation. In this context, communities and individuals must know in advance what to do and where to evacuate to. Tsunami warning centres (TWC) must have clear standard operating procedures that can be rapidly executed to issue alerts, and the TWC staff must be well-trained and prepared to act quickly and decisively.  Recognizing that local tsunamis remain the most challenging operation for countries, the 2019 ITP-Hawaii will focus its training on Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for warning and emergency response as guided by the draft National Tsunami Warning Center Minimum Competency Levels and the Local-Source Tsunami Response Best Practice approved this past April at the 28th session of the Intergovernmental Coordination Group for the Pacific Tsunami Warning and Mitigation System (Nicaragua, 2–5 April 2019). The training will also focus on preparedness and tsunami evacuation planning, including inundation and evacuation mapping, response planning, and exercising, in the context of meeting the guidelines of the UNESCO-IOC Tsunami Ready Programme for community recognition. On the last day, a tsunami exercise will be conducted requiring country decision-making and action using national products supplemented by the PTWC Enhanced Products.  ITP-Hawaii is open primarily to all country members of ICG/PTWS and ICG/CARIBE-EWS. Participants from other regional tsunami warning systems are welcome. On Day 1, participants are expected to give a 15-minute presentation on their country’s tsunami warning and mitigation system, including their tsunami SOPs." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "The ITIC Training Program on Tsunami Early Warning and Mitigation Systems has focused since 2005 on improving operating procedures for tsunami warning and emergency response as essential for successful tsunami warning. While infrequent, tsunamis can be extremely deadly because of their quick onset and immediate impact in minutes. In order to warn quickly and have the public evacuate when necessary, agencies must pre-plan and have protocols and procedures which are well-known to every stakeholder and to the public, and which are well-exercised and practiced. Communities must know their hazard and risk, and prepare in advance, so that every person can recognize the tsunami danger and know what to do to save their lives.  Week one will focus on earthquake seismology and tsunami hazard assessment for planning and warning decision-making. Week two will focus on the end-to-end tsunami warning and emergency response chain, focusing on the importance of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for enabling consistent and rapid tsunami warning and response, and using Chile as a working example. SOP development is a dynamic process, and each event is unique in its generation and impact, and so also in its response. In every event, we learn a little more about the science of tsunamis and how to better mitigate against their impact.  Training activities will include warning decision-making, use of decision-support tools, evacuation planning, public awareness, drills, a field trip to understand tsunami deposits, and site visits to agencies involved in response. Emphasis will also be placed on building community preparedness, especially for local tsunamis, through Tsunami Ready programs." ;

A TEMPP country team should be comprised of, at a minimum, all participants to the TEMPP trainings. It should include scientists (responsible for tsunami hazard risk assessment and tsunami inundation modeling), GIS experts (responsible for making maps), emergency managers (responsible for tsunami public safety and preparedness), and tsunami warning center staff (responsible for issuing warnings for during events).    EXPERTS MEETING ON EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI HAZARD IN HONDURAS: HISTORICAL EVENTS AND POTENTIAL SOURCES, 29 FEBRUARY – 1 MARCH 2016  Tsunamis can affect Honduras coastlines facing the Pacific Ocean and the Gulf of Honduras and Caribbean Sea. Relatively few tsunami runups have been reported for Honduras over history, thus necessitating the use of scenario events for hazard assessment. The purpose of this expert scientific meeting is to quantify earthquake and tsunami sources for use in tsunami risk reduction projects in Honduras. The identified maximum credible earthquake scenarios will be used by Honduras to conduct tsunami inundation modelling for evacuation mapping of its Pacific and Caribbean coastlines.  TSUNAMI INUNDATION MAP DEVELOPMENT, 2 -3 MARCH 2016  The training builds from the July 2015 Tsunami Modeling (ComMIT) training to cover basic composite inundation mapping using QGIS including creating composite inundation map, exporting inundation and maximum wave amplitudes to GIS format and QGIS validation of results." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "Libraries traditionally have formed a preservation safety net for materials that will be transmitted to subsequent generations of information seekers and scholars. For paper-based documents, provision of adequate storage conditions was the best means to help ensure that materials would remain readable far into the future. With the advent of digital technology, many knowledge creators do their work on computers. Some of that knowledge may be printed on paper, but much of it, particularly databases, geographic information, scientific data sets, and Web sites, exists only in electronic form. At the same time, traditional forms of publications have changed significantly and, as a result, create new challenges. For example, publishers of electronic journals license their content to libraries, but libraries do not own that content and they may not have rights to capture digital content to preserve it. Who will preserve these materials?    Which organizations or systems will provide the needed preservation safety net for electronic materials? What tools, technologies and standards are available to preserve information in digital format?  What are the best practices that can help us to address long-term digital archiving for a range of file formats and media types?   This course will examine these questions, as well as provide an introduction to the metadata needed for a digital environment, terminology, cross walking, harvesting, interoperability and metadata frequently used to describe digital collections. Practical hands-on exercises will be included. Through a combination of lecture, case studies and interactive sessions, students will learn about the long-term preservation requirements of digital assets.

    <https://schema.org/description> "BACKGROUND  The rapid development of operational oceanography in recent years has led to improved access to realtime data and products generated from in-situ and satellite observations as well as ocean modelling. Examples of such observations in the African oceans and coasts include the Argo programme, which  collects temperature and salinity data from more than 3,500 buoys deployed in many parts of the world oceans, and the network of sea level stations established by IOC and other organizations under the framework of the Joint IOC-WMO Technical Commission for Oceanography and Marine Meteorology (JCOMM) and the IOC-led Global Ocean Observing System (GOOS). A number of large open data sets and metadata from observations (in situ and remote sensing) and from model outputs exist which have application to a number of challenges and problems in coastal environments. The International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange (IODE) programme has assisted several institutions in Africa to access these data sets through the Ocean Data and Information Network for Africa (ODINAFRICA). However these resources have not been utilised optimally in Africa due to limited capacities, and lack of information on their availability and applicability.  The goal of the African Summer School on Application of Ocean and Coastal Data and Modelling Products is to build African capacity to access and utilize ocean and coastal data (and relevant meteorological data) from insitu and satellite observations, as well as those generated from ocean models to produce useful services for local use, for a wide variety of human and economic benefit purposes. On the basis of case studies, the participants will learn how to optimise the use of widely available data and analysis tools.    The specific objectives will be to:  (i) Identify and define data products necessary to address the priority issues (e.g. coastal hazard preparedness, sound ecosystem management, efficient navigation and maritime safety, weather forecasts, management of fisheries, and tourism) and identify and document relevant sources of real-time (and near-real time) ocean data sets required to generate them   (ii) Train participants from Africa on how to access appropriate ocean data, and utilize specific tools and analyses to generate products for management of the ocean and coastal environment and resources applications.  (iii) Prepare and disseminate manuals and course materials providing information on tools for discovery, analysis and visualization of relevant data and products to marine and coastal related training and research institutions in Africa   (iv) Disseminate the data products generated using the data sets and tools identified to a wide range of users. The initiative will enable the utilization of data sets from global/regional ocean programmes for management of coastal environment and resources. This will in turn result in the identification of data gaps that need to be addressed. The demonstration of practical usage of the data sets will encourage member states to increase their investments in ocean observations. The emphasis will be on using freely available data, products and tools. However selected commercial software will be demonstrated during the training.  The network of experts and institutions created will provide a forum for exchange of ideas and experiences." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "Overview  The current suite of Earth Observation satellites and models offer access to an unprecedented amount of information on the marine environment. Concurrently, there is a growing demand in research, governance, and commercial marine sectors, for personnel who can use this data. Training providers across these sectors is essential for maximizing the utility of this data and building necessary capacity. This course offers participants the opportunity to work with other trainers to incorporate the use of Copernicus marine data from EUMETSAT and the Copernicus Marine Service (CMEMS) into their own educational activities. Participants will learn how to use open access resources available through the Copernicus programme, and co-develop their own resources with a network of fellow participants and trainers from IODE, CMEMS, and EUMETSAT. The course will be held online and involve self-directed and interactive learning.  Key Outcomes  After the course participants will have the knowledge, skills and experience to be able:    to teach the use of Copernicus Sentinel-3 and CMEMS data for marine applications, covering the use of sea surface temperature, altimetry and ocean colour data, as well as downstream products and model outputs.  to teach others how to access the Copernicus Marine Data through online portals, APIs and other methods. &nbsp;  to teach the basic principles of the processing methods applied to the Copernicus Sentinel-3 instruments (and similar sensors) to derive the marine products.  to explain how to assess data quality (including basic principles of validation) and select appropriate products for different tasks.  to understand the use of the following tools in training &ndash; SNAP, Remote Sensing Digital Teaching Tool, Git, Python (and Jupyter notebooks), cloud computing (WEkEO).  Select and adapt existing resources and develop new resources for their own training activities.    &nbsp;Instructors    Lauren Biermann (EUMETSAT/PML)  Oliver Clements (EUMETSAT/PML)  Hayley Evers-King (EUMETSAT)  Fabrice Messal (CMEMS/Mercator Ocean)  Greg Reed (IOC/IODE)  Claudia Delgado (IOC/IODE)  others to be announced    Target Audience    University teachers, mentors and tutors  Staff from National Oceanographic centres and marine research/management institutions with teaching/training responsibilities    NOTE: UNESCO and EUMETSAT are committed to promote equal access principles. Therefore, applications from minority or underrepresented groups are strongly encouraged.  Course Pre-requisites  Applicants are expected to:    have an understanding of marine science and satellite based Earth Observation  have teaching experience or currently preparing for a teaching / training roles  have a working knowledge of English    NOTE: wishing to learn about Copernicus marine data for their own purposes, should consider applying for other courses offered by EUMETSAT and CMEMS.

This training workshop will cover tsunami warning operations and the use of the PTWC Enhanced Products for tsunami threat decision-making, with specific attention on the tsunami warning chain and their standard operating procedures (SOPs).    Topics will include warning and response SOPs and challenges, warning decision support tools, warning messages and alerting, evacuation concepts and planning, and awareness strategies.  Over the last 10+ years, with improvements in data quality, quantity, and real-time availability, PTWC’s response time has dropped significantly from an hour to 5-10 minutes for tsunami events.  At the same time, with each great earthquake and tsunami since the 26 December 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami helping to increase scientific understanding, better techniques have been developed to quickly characterize the earthquake and numerically model the tsunami.  In the Pacific, the PTWS adopted use of the PTWC enhanced products based on numerical forecast models on 1 October 2014.  For the Caribbean and adjacent regions, the changeover to PTWC’s new enhanced forecast products was approved by the ICG/CARIBE-EWS VIII (2013), introduced in CARIBE WAVE 2013, and issued in parallel from October 26, 2015.  The changeover to solely the new products took place on 1 March 2016.    Due to the impacts of meteorological events during the 2017 hurricane season, lessons to be learned, particularly in relation to communications, will also be discussed.  " ;

Therefore, the processes that determine these phenomena  are critical for a complete understanding of the seas around us. The course  will include a brief description of  observational features, but it will  emphasize   the theoretical framework that underlies them.   The course will cover: (i)Large-scale circulation of the open ocean-Observations, simulations with general circulation and simple models, and the processes underlying the dynamics (ii)Comparison of model simulations with direct current measurements (iii)Shelf circulation (iv)Instabilities: Eddies, fronts, and filaments. The goal of this course is to provide a dynamical foundation for understanding oceanographic  phenomena on a range of temporal and spatial scales." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "Eleven percent of the world’s fatal tsunamis over history have occurred in the Caribbean and its  adjacent seas, including the Atlantic, with almost 100 tsunamis having impacted 23 countries of the region. Member States of the Intergovernmental Coordination Group for the Tsunami and Other Coastal Hazards Warning System for the Caribbean and Adjacent Regions (ICG/CARIBE-EWS) are preparing to face the dangers of tsunamis from distant, regional and local sources. Many Caribbean Member countries depend primarily on the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) for the advice to their Tsunami Warning Focal Points and National Tsunami Warning Centres. With the ongoing implementation of the PTWC new enhanced tsunami products, it is of utmost importance to train Member States to continue receive and accurately interpret messages in order to respond to a tsunami in a timely and responsible manner to save lives.    Significant scientific and technological advances have been made to better forecast tsunami impacts in real time and to present forecast information graphically since the establishment of the current PTWC products for the CARIBE-EWS. Based on these advances and IOC TOWS Working Group recommendations for more globally consistent and useful Tsunami Service Provider products, the ICG/CARIBE-EWS has approved the dissemination of the PTWC Enhanced Tsunami Products to Member States. In the proposed PTWC implementation schedule the plan is to begin issuance of the enhanced products in parallel with current products to the CARIBE-EWS on 26 October 2015 with full transition to the new products on 1st March 2016. These new products put more responsibility on the national and local authorities for developing and issuing the corresponding warning products.    The workshop will be conducted in English through lecture-discussion, multimedia presentations and simulations with the aim to train participants in the interpretation and implementation of the new suite of enhanced operational tsunami forecast products.    The workshop is being organised by the Caribbean Tsunami Information Centre (CTIC), the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (UNESCO/IOC), the International  Tsunami Information Center (ITIC), the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC), The US NWS Caribbean Tsunami Warning Program (CTWP) and the Coastal Zone Management Unit (CZMU),  Barbados in collaboration with the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research Scientists  (UCAR) Joint Office of Science Support, NOAA, NWS, U.S.A. Financial support is being provided  by the UNESCO/IOC and the United States Agency for International Development/Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (USAID/OFDA)." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "The 4-day training will cover the explanation and use of the newly-inaugurated South China Sea Tsunami Advisory Center (SCSTAC) Products, the Japan Meteorological Agency's Northwest Pacific Tsunami Advisory Center (JMA NWPTAC) New Enhanced Products, and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) Enhanced Products by National Tsunami Warning Centers and Emergency Response Agencies.  Topics will cover the end-to-end warning process, warning center and emergency response operational challenges, community preparedness, advanced topics in tsunami warning center operations, and the methodology, use, interpretation, and limitations of the SCSTAC, NWPTAC, and PTWC Products.  Over the last 15+ years, with improvements in data quality, quantity, and real-time availability, TWC response times have dropped significantly from nearly an hour to 5-10 minutes for tsunami events.  At the same time, each great earthquake and tsunami since the 26 December 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami has increased our scientific understanding, and better techniques with faster computing platforms are enabling us to quickly and reliably characterize the earthquake and then numerically model the tsunami.  This has led to significant improvements in a warning center’s ability to accurately forecast coastal wave height and impact, and an ability to provide timely advice to support tsunami warning decision-making.    At the ICG/PTWS-XXV (September 2013), Member States approved the start of the PTWC Enhanced Products on 1 October 2014.  These products were the first large-scale modifications in decades, whereupon the PTWC ceased issuing Warnings and Watches, and now issues only informational tsunami wave forecasts.  Public text products continue, but the additional graphical and statistical enhanced products are only sent to authorized Tsunami Warning Focal Points (TWFP).  At the ICG/PTWS-XXVI (April 2015), Member States agreed that following the PTWC implementation, the NWPTAC should proceed with the development of its enhanced products. The NWPTAC enhanced products consist of an initial text message using information from a pre-established tsunami database, and are followed by text and graphical messages that include results from real-time simulations, and sent solely to NWPTAC TWFP. With IOC Circular Letter 2702 (13 December 2017), the JMA NWPTAC commenced issuance of its NWPTAC Enhanced Products in experimental mode on 20 December 2017, in parallel with its existing products.      At the ICG/PTWS-XXII (March 2017), Member States agreed to form a Task Team on the Establishment of a South China Sea Tsunami Advisory Center and accepted the offer of the Government of China to host the SCSTAC at the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center (NMEFC).  Through IOC Circular Letter 2706 (5 January 2018), the China’s SCSTAC commenced trial issuance of its SCSTAC Products on 26 January 2018.  The training is being organized by the International Tsunami Information Center (ITIC) in collaboration with the IOC, the SCSTAC and the Northwest Pacific Tsunami Advisory Center (NWPTAC). The training is hosted by the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center (NMEFC) of the State Oceanic Administration of China (SOA)." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "The Pacific Ocean and its adjacent seas is the largest, most diverse and most prone to tsunamis of all the Earth’s oceans. Pacific nations must be prepared to face the dangers of tsunami from distant, regional and local sources. In the past, Pacific Island Member States depended primarily on the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) for the warning decisions of National Tsunami Warning Centers. However, the reality of the dangers posed by local and regional sources has required Member States to address these tsunami risks and improve and expand the capabilities of the National Tsunami Warning Centers and Disaster Management Offices and engage in regional collaboration.  This one-week activity will consist of two workshops. The theme of the first three and a half -days training workshop will be on \"Strengthening Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Tsunami Warning and Emergency Response (including using the new PTWC Enhanced Tsunami Products)\".  The second  workshop will be a one and half days Regional Consultation convened by the PTWS Working Group 2 Task Team on Enhanced Products to provide feedback on the understandability and use of the PTWC Enhanced Products, and their readiness for the expected PTWC product changeover in 2014. The  workshops will be conducted in English.    The workshops are being organized by the International Tsunami Information Center in collaboration with the IOC and New Zealand, and will be hosted by the New Zealand Ministry of Civil Defence & Emergency Management." ;

The language of trainings will be Spanish. Course materials will be in both Spanish and English.    TEMPP emphasizes a team approach for building country tsunami preparedness.   Each TEMPP training builds from the previous training, and it is assumed that once trained, participants will share the information learned on return to their country. A TEMPP country team should be comprised of, at a minimum, all participants to the TEMPP trainings. It should include scientists (responsible for tsunami hazard risk assessment and tsunami inundation modeling), GIS experts (responsible for making maps), emergency managers (responsible for tsunami public safety and preparedness), and tsunami warning center staff (responsible for issuing warnings for during events).    The \"Basic Tsunami Preparedness: Tsunami Evacuation Plans, Maps and Procedures\" pilot course will train countries to prepare tsunami evacuation maps based on science and community needs. Globally standardized tools and methodologies will be applied in the course. The first training will cover tsunami modelling for flood mapping. Topics covered will include tectonic plates, tsunami science, bathymetry and topography grids, seismic source parameters, forecasting methodology, tsunami modeling, tsunami hazard assessment, and the use of the MOST model and ComMIT tool." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "The 3-day training will cover the explanation and use of the PTWC New Enhanced Tsunami Forecast Products by National Tsunami Warning Centers and Emergency Response Agencies.  Topics will cover the end-to-end warning process, warning center and emergency response operational challenges, advanced topics in tsunami warning center operations, and the methodologies, use, interpretation, and limitations of the PTWC Enhanced Products.  Over the last 10+ years, with improvements in data quality, quantity, and real-time availability, PTWC’s response time has dropped significantly from an hour to 5-10 minutes for tsunami events.  At the same time, with each great earthquake and tsunami since 26 December 2004 helping to increase scientific understanding, better techniques have been developed to quickly characterize the earthquake and numerically model the tsunami.  This in turn has led to significant improvements in a warning center’s ability to accurately forecast coastal wave height and impact, and an ability to provide timely advice to support local tsunami warning decision-making.   At the ICG/PTWS-XXV (September 2013), Member States approved the start of the PTWC Enhanced Products on October 1, 2014.  These products, the first large-scale modifications in decades, fundamentally change the way in which countries assess their national tsunami threats.  The PTWC will cease providing Warnings and Watches, and instead issue advisory tsunami wave forecasts.  Public text products will continue to be issued, but the additional graphical and statistical products will only be sent to authorized PTWS Tsunami Warning Focal Points (TWFP)." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "The Pacific Ocean and its adjacent seas is the largest, most diverse and most prone to tsunamis of all the Earth’s oceans. Pacific nations must be prepared to face the dangers of tsunami from distant, regional and local sources. In the past, Pacific Member countries depended primarily on the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) for the warning decisions of National Tsunami Warning Centers. However, the reality of the dangers posed by local and regional sources has required Member States to address these tsunami risks and improve and expand the capabilities of the National Tsunami Warning Centers and Disaster Management Offices and engage in regional collaboration.  In this context, we are pleased to invite South China Sea countries, the Republic of Korea and the Russian Federation to nominate up to two candidates to participate in a Regional Tsunami Training Workshop on the ICG/PTWS PTWC New Enhanced Tsunami Products, to be held in Beijing, China from 21 to 25 October 2013.  One candidate should be from the tsunami warning authority and one from the National Disaster Management organisation.  The theme of the training workshop will be on \"Strengthening Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Tsunami Warning and Emergency Response (including using the new PTWC Enhanced Tsunami Products)\".  The training is being organized by the International Tsunami Information Center in collaboration with the IOC and the Government of China, and will be hosted by the National Marine Environmental Forecasting Center (NMEFC) of State Oceanic Administration (SOA)." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "Data management has been identified, amongst others during the ‘Colour of Ocean Data Symposium’ (Brussels, 2002), as a gap in the curricula of many academic institutions. To try and fill this gap, this course on data management is proposed jointly by the IOC Project Office for IODE (Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO Project Office for International Oceanographic Data and Information Exchange Committee) and VLIZ (Flanders Marine Institute). The course will be specific for biodiversity data management, going into details on specific data needs for taxonomy and geography. The course will be a combination of lectures and hands-on activities. The final sessions will be devoted to development of a pilot application, and reporting and analysis based on this application.    Being a joint IODE/MarBEF training course, the participants to the course will be not only from EU countries. IODE-sponsored participants will be invited from non-EU countries, both from developing countries and from Eastern Europe.    Tentative audience    The course is in the first place directed at junior biodiversity/biogeography scientists. But everyone with an interest in biodiversity data management is welcome. Being familiar with computers (Office applications, Windows operating system, installing applications) is a prerequisite.    Standard  capacity of the training room is 16. It is expected that about half of the available spaces will be for MarBEF participants (from EU), half for the IODE-sponsored participants. The IODE-sponsored participants will be selected as a rule via the IODE ODINs coordinators.    Relation with MarBEF objectives    Proper management of biodiversity data will enhance data exchange; some of the topics of the course will assist scientists in making data available to MarBEF, through ERMS and EurOBIS. The course will be an opportunity for young researchers to meet, and to discuss joint activities.    Financial support    Participants form EU countries will be requested to finance their own travel and accommodation using MarBEF funds. Travel and accommodation of the selected participants from developing countries and Eastern Europe will be paid by the IOC Project Office for IODE." ;

IOC invites the Caribbean Tsunami Warning Focal Points and Tsunami National Contacts to nominate a sea-level station professional to participate in this training course. The person should be responsible for conducting and supporting the data analysis and quality control of the sea-level stations in your country. Participants should also have skills with computers and processing databases, basic knowledge on oceanographic concepts; and should hold a permanent position with a national or regional agency. Before attending the training, participants are expected to become familiar with the volumes of the IOC sea-level Manuals and Guides 14 available at http://www.psmsl.org/train_and_info/training/manuals/.  Currently over 76 sea-level stations in the Caribbean and adjacent regions are contributing to the CARIBE-EWS and are available to the Tsunami Service Providers and National Tsunami Warning Centres. The data are also important for monitoring other short-term (e.g. storm surges) and long-term sea-level changes. The course will include training on TASK, the UK NOC Tidal Analysis Software Kit. TASK is a suite of programmes that includes quality control, harmonic analysis, tidal prediction, formatted tide table production, data manipulation and the calculation of daily and monthly means (see http://noc.ac.uk/business/marine-data-products/tidal-analysis.

    <https://schema.org/description> "The Caribbean and its adjacent seas, including the Atlantic, have been the source region for 11 % of the world’s fatal tsunamis over history, with almost 100 tsunamis observed that have impacted 23 countries of this region.  Member States of the Intergovernmental Coordination Group for the Tsunami and Other Coastal Hazards Warning System for the Caribbean and Adjacent Regions (ICG/CARIBE) must be prepared to face the dangers of tsunamis from distant, regional and local sources. While many Caribbean Member countries continue to depend primarily on the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) for the warning advice to their National Tsunami Warning Centres, the reality of the dangers posed by local and regional sources does require Member States to: (i) identify and assess their tsunami risk; (ii) improve and expand the capabilities of their National Tsunami Warning Centres (NTWC)/Tsunami Warning Focal Points (TWFP) and Disaster Management Offices (NDMO) in order to respond to a tsunami in a timely and responsible manner to save lives; and (iii) engage in regional collaboration to build a strong warning and mitigation system.   This Regional Tsunami Training Workshop on Strengthening Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) for Tsunami Warning and Emergency Response and the Development of the ICG/CARIBE-EWS PTWC New Enhanced Products will be held in Mexico City, Mexico, 1-5 April 2014. The training that will be conducted in English, with simultaneous Spanish translation.    The training is being organized by the International Tsunami Information Center (Hawaii), in collaboration with the IOC ICG/CARIBE-EWS Secretariat, the Caribbean Tsunami Information Center (CTIC) and the Caribbean Tsunami Warning Program (CTWP), with the support of the United States Agency for International Development/Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance USAID/OFDA, UNESCO, the Government of Mexico through its Navy Secretary (Secretaria de Marina SEMAR), the Government of Barbados through its Department of Emergency Management and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Office for Barbados.

The goal of RMICs is to facilitate adherence of observational data and metadata and processed observational products to higher level standards for instruments and methods of observation.  The second JCOMM Marine Instrumentation workshop will be held at the RMIC for the Asia-Pacific region. The workshop is expected to help developing capacities of countries from the region involved in the making of marine meteorological and other appropriate oceanographic observations. One can expect that such activities would eventually improve quality, consistency, traceability of the observations made available to end users in the region, including National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs); hence improving final products and services delivered by all in the region." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "Course Overview  Marine scientific research (MSR) plays a critical role in sustainable development as consistently recognized by the UN General Assembly in its annual resolutions on oceans and the law of the sea. Research, and the tools required to conduct it, are essential for the sustainable development of the oceans and the seas and their resources, including by supporting informed decisions on the conservation and sustainable use of the marine environment and its resources, and by helping to understand, predict and respond to natural disasters and climate change. Increased MSR through capacity--development strengthening the capacity of States, in particular Small Island Developing States (SIDS), to implement the relevant MSR provisions of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) as well as similar provisions in other instruments, is essential for increasing the MSR being conducted in the world&rsquo;s oceans. This course will provide an overview of the legal, technical and scientific aspects of the MSR regime, particularly with respect to consent procedures, so as to reinforce the participants&rsquo; knowledge of the rights and obligations of coastal and researching States. It will also touch upon matters relating to the development and transfer of marine technology under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.  Aims and Objectives    Raising awareness of government officials involved in processing requests for MSR and of the research community about the international legal framework for conducting marine scientific research and the transfer of marine technology  Strengthening the understanding of the functions, responsibilities and practices of each of the groups of individuals involved in MSR in coastal States and researching States  Strengthening cooperation for the conduct of MSR and transfer of marine technology In the Mediterranean region  Building a network of scientists and government officials involved in MSR to strengthen regional cooperation for the conduct of MSR  Increasing awareness of the benefits of developing a coordination mechanism related to MSR at the national level, including to process requests for consent;  Encouraging the adoption of national measures promoting and facilitating the conduct of marine scientific research    Target Audience  The target audience includes, but is not limited to, the following:    Government officials from both developing coastal States and researching States, who are involved or will potentially be involved in one of the following:  Coordinating the implementation of MSR;  Responding to requests for consent;  Requesting consent;  Assessing the scientific aspects of requests for consent;  Dealing with research data dissemination and follow-up to MSR.  Scientists from both developing coastal States and researching States, who are involved or will potentially be involved in one of the following:  Assessing the scientific aspects of requests for consent;  Participating in MSR projects;  Interpreting and managing data, samples and research results.      Course Topics (may be subject to slight changes)    Introduction to MSR under UNCLOS    UNCLOS and MSR: general aspects  MSR in the various maritime zones  Marine scientific research installations and equipment    Transfer of Marine Technology    UNCLOS and development and transfer of marine technology  IOC Criteria and Guidelines on Transfer of Marine Technology    Preparing for an MSR Project    The planning stage  The request for consent  Responding to a request for consent  Experience in the North African and European countries     Conducting MSR    Participation of the coastal State  Major changes in the project and port calls    Follow up to MSR Project    Assessment and management of data, samples and research results; Sharing of results, data and samples (scientific and legal aspects)  Use of data  Removal of installations and equipment  Responsibility and liability and dispute settlement    Presentation of the EU strategy for marine scientific research    &nbsp;  Instructors    Stephanie Ierino&nbsp;  Snježana&nbsp;Žarić  Laura Giuliano  Greg Reed  Erik Franckx  Claudia Delgado  Gert Verreet    &nbsp;  NOTE: priority will be given to participants originating from North Africa and Europe.

    <https://schema.org/description> "The International Phytoplankton Intercomparison (IPI) is an international partnership to provide enumeration and identification quality assurance in marine phytoplankton. It was formerly part of the now concluded EU initiative Biological Effects Quality Assurance in Monitoring Programmes (BEQUALM).    The IPI is implementing its intercomparison exercises through the Marine Institute Ireland in cooperation with the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission of UNESCO (IOC) through its Science and Communication Centre on Harmful Algae at the University of Copenhagen, Denmark.    The IPI operates according to the ISO standards 17043 Conformity assessment-General requirements for proficiency testing and ISO13528 Statistical methods for use in proficiency testing by interlaboratory comparisons. We are currently applying for accreditation for 2017 under ISO17043 to the Irish national Accreditation Board (INAB) for the IPI to be accredited as a proficiency testing scheme.  Also, as part of this push towards accreditation, the Marine Institute have sanctioned a Lab attendant position to help with the organization of the exercise, production of materials, methodology improvements and working on a document control system for the accredited process.     These changes are essential for the continuation of the scheme and in order to attain the accreditation under ISO17043. The IPI will have a board consisting of representatives of the Marine Institute and IOC UNESCO. These members can invite additional partners to be represented on the board. The IPI management of finances and payments is via the Marine Institute, Ireland.     At present, the main parameters measured under the IPI exercise are the composition and abundance of marine phytoplankton in preserved marine water samples. We are studying the possibility of including biovolume and carbon content calculation to the scheme as a measure of biomass which may be needed in the future for some laboratories working under the Water Framework Directive (WFD) rules. The water quality EN documents EN14996, Water quality - Guidance on assuring the quality of biological and ecological assessments in the aquatic environment and EN 15204, Water quality - Guidance standard for the routine analysis of phytoplankton abundance and composition using inverted microscopy (Utermöhl technique) do not include how to estimate biovolume in water. That’s why the CEN/TC 230 (WP7) draft guidance document was developed in 2014; a European standard on the estimation of algal biovolume as a development and improvement of standards in support of the WFD.  It describes a general procedure for the determination or estimation of biovolume of marine and freshwater phytoplankton taxa using the inverted microscopy (Utermöhl technique). The determination of phytoplankton abundance and composition according to EN 15204 is a precondition for the calculation of the biovolume of a phytoplankton samples.    It makes sense for us to include this measurement as we already fulfill this pre-condition (abundance and composition), so it would be easy to add a measure of biovolume to those participants that may require it.     There would be an additional fee for this add-on to the scheme for those participants that would like to participate in the biovolume part of the exercise. We are proposing to collaborate with Aquaecology an environmental agency based in Germany as they have already carried out a biovolume exercise in 2014 and they have an online system already in place for the calculation of biovolume.     This also could attract more participants to our scheme from laboratories already participating in the biovolume exercise with Aquaecology.      Partnerships:    The IPI is a partnership of agencies, quality control entities and organizations with interest in phytoplankton monitoring and quality control. Partnership will allow for endorsement on IPI certificates of proficiency by national or regional partners where this will enhance the value of certificates to participants in the proficiency testing.    The UK National Marine Biological Analytical Quality Control Scheme (NMBAQC) is one of these partners. They have been associated with the IPI scheme (formerly Bequalm) since the beginning in 2005 as the umbrella group for UK laboratories participating in community analysis intercomparison exercises." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "The ITIC Training Program on has focused since 2005 on improving operating procedures for tsunami warning and emergency response as essential for successful tsunami warning. While infrequent, tsunamis can be extremely deadly because of their no-notice, quick onset and immediate impact in minutes. In order to warn quickly and have the public evacuate when necessary, agencies must pre-plan and have protocols and procedures which are well-known to every stakeholder and to the public, and which are well-exercised and practiced.  For local tsunamis, communities must also know the natural tsunami warning signs and self-evacuate immediately to safe areas.    This training follows the tsunami warning chain from detection and threat analysis to warning dissemination, and cancellation.  Topics will include earthquake and tsunami science, warning center operations, use of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center products and decision-support tools, and public information or media engagement.  Emphasis is on the importance of Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for enabling consistent and rapid tsunami warning.  SOP development is a dynamic process, and each event is unique in its generation and impact, and so also in its response. With every event, we learn more about the science of tsunamis and how to better warn and mitigate against their impact.     " ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "The training workshop will cover tsunami warning operations and the use of the PTWC Enhanced Products for tsunami threat decision-making, with specific attention on the warning and emergency response plan and standard operating procedures (SOPs) of the Solomon Islands. Topics will include warning and response SOPs and challenges, warning decision support tools, warning messages and alerting, evacuation concepts and planning, and awareness strategies. Over the last 10+ years, with improvements in data quality, quantity, and real-time availability, PTWC’s response time has dropped significantly from an hour to 5-10 minutes for tsunami events. At the same time, with each great earthquake and tsunami since 26 December 2004 helping to increase scientific understanding, better techniques have been developed to quickly characterize the earthquake and numerically model the tsunami. In 2014, the PTWC implemented Enhanced Products for the PTWS that now include wave amplitude forecasts in both text and graphical formats, and that require each country to explicitly assign Warning / Watch status in their own messages to their coasts. In July 2015, the First Pacific Ministerial Meeting on Meteorology adopted the Nuku'alofa Declaration, calling for support to ensure that National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) have the necessary capacity to support sustainable development, and specifically for the need to strengthen their tsunami early warning systems. Accordingly, the goal of this training is to increase the capacity of first responder operational staff to efficiently and effectively respond to tsunamis." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "    Introduction    Among many coastal countries Marine Spatial Planning (MSP) has become the preferred management approach to address increasing conflicts among multiple uses of coastal and marine areas, including their contiguous exclusive economic zones (EEZs). Over the next decade another 30 countries, including the coastal countries of the European Union (EU) and USA, will develop and approve marine spatial plans that will cover about a third of the surface area of the world’s EEZs. IOC-UNESCO has provided guidance and training to many of these MSP initiatives and is recognized as the leading international organization on MSP issues.  A common theme underpinning these concepts is the importance of ecosystem-based approaches to manage human uses and sustain ecosystem services while adapting to the impacts of climate change. The new challenges of climate variability and change, alongside the other existing drivers that cause depletion and degradation within coastal and marine ecosystems, increases the urgency and the need to scale up these efforts at national and regional scales. There is now a need to support adaptive ecosystem-management and governance that is informed by and evolves through ongoing learning and adaptive processes, to help increase the resilience and well-being of societies dependent on marine goods and services.  In the regional context, many initiatives at the scale of Large Marine Ecosystems (LMEs) are leading activities on improving our understanding of coastal and marine systems by developing robust databases and information products to support coastal and marine governance.  In Africa, the LME projects in Agulhas-Somali, Benguela and Canary Current are good examples of the work that LME practitioners are currently undertaking on coastal and marine governance. Likewise, the African Union, through the 2050 African Integrated Marine Strategy, also aims to achieve a comprehensive and effective plan to understand the existing and future challenges with regards to socio-economic development and coastal and marine ecosystems.      Objectives    - Strengthening the global and regional network of partners to enhance ecosystem-based management and to provide support for integrated coastal area management and MSP through the development of coastal and marine web atlases. Building on existing initiatives in Africa, Caribbean and Latin America. (South-South).  - Development of decision support tools to increase synergies to implement the methodological concepts for both ICAM and MSP, and to facilitate communication, dissemination, and outreach activities.  - Development of capacities and partnership building through twinning and learning exchanges, workshops, and training in the context of OceanTeacher and the International Coastal Atlas Network ICAN-IODE Project." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "Las costas occidentales de Sudamérica se caracterizan por su alta sismicidad. Existen muchas fallas geológicas en el área costera y los sismos de esta zona generaron en el siglo pasado varios tsunamis destructores a lo largo del litoral ecuatoriano. Se conoce que el Ecuador fue afectado por cinco tsunamis en el siglo XX (1906, 1933, 1953, 1958 y 1979).  Más recientemente, el tsunami generado por el gran terremoto del Este de Japón del  11 marzo de 2011 tuvo efectos visibles importantes en las Galápagos .  En vista de esta alta frecuencia de tsunamis en Ecuador se estima imprescindible el fortalecimiento del Sistema Nacional de Alerta de Tsunamis del Ecuador.   La UNESCO, con el apoyo de las instituciones nacionales relevantes, entre otras la Secretaría Nacional de gestión de Riesgo SGNR, el Instituto Oceanográfico de la Armada del Ecuador INOCAR y el Instituto Geofísico de la Escuela Politécnica del Litoral ESPOL,  con financiamiento del Programa ECHO de la Unión Europea, convoca a este taller de fortalecimiento del Sistema Nacional de Alerta de Tsunamis del Ecuador.

    <https://schema.org/description> "Dentro del Caribe, La Española está localizada en una de las áreas con mayor actividad y potencial sísmico y de tsunamis.  En 1946 una serie de sismos en el norte de la República Dominicana tuvieron un impacto muy grande por los efectos directos de los terremotos como por los tsunamis que se generaron.  Según algunos registros históricos (NOAA) 1,865 personas perecieron a causa de los tsunamis.  Tan reciente como en el 2010,  Haití y el mundo entero fueron testigos de las devastadoras consecuencias que puede tener un terremoto si no se toman las medidas de seguridad correspondientes.  En esa ocasión, también se generó un tsunami para el cual se emitió una alerta para la República Dominicana y por fortuna no representó mayores consecuencias.    Dado el peligro potencial de que un Tsunami impacte en cualquier momento las costas de la República Dominicana y el riesgo para las vidas y el bienestar general que representa, FUNGLODE en su misión de contribuir al desarrollo sostenible del país,  propone al sector hotelero y turístico el primer taller sobre el tema de preparación y respuesta a tsunamis.  Los objetivos de la actividad son que los participantes adquieran los conocimientos de base sobre los tsunamis, conozcan el estado actual del saber científico sobre tsunamis en la República Dominicana, se informen sobre los procedimientos nacionales de alerta y puedan iniciar planes de preparación y respuesta a tsunamis.  FUNGLODE ha logrado reunir invitados expertos nacionales  (DEFENSA CIVIL, ISU/UASD, ONAMET, GLOBAL MATRIX) e internacionales (Comisión Oceanográfica Intergubernamental de UNESCO, Caribbean Tsunami Warning Program del Servicio Nacional de Meteorología de los EEUU, Red Sísmica de Puerto Rico (Universidad de Puerto Rico), para apoyar a la seguridad y economía de la industria turística de la República Dominicana.  Además de la presentación de los expertos en sesiones plenarias, la dinámica del taller incluirá trabajo en grupos y ejercicios de mesa.   Se pretende que al final de los tres días del taller, los participantes logren iniciar el desarrollo de sus propios planes de preparación y respuesta a tsunamis y/o complementen los ya existentes." ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "The training workshop will cover tsunami warning operations and the use of the PTWC Enhanced Products for tsunami threat decision-making, with specific attention on the warning and emergency response plan and standard operating procedures (SOPs) of the Cook Islands. Topics will include warning and response SOPs and challenges, warning decision support tools, warning messages and alerting, evacuation concepts and planning, and awareness strategies. Over the last 10+ years, with improvements in data quality, quantity, and real-time availability, PTWC’s response time has dropped significantly from an hour to 5-10 minutes for tsunami events. At the same time, with each great earthquake and tsunami since 26 December 2004 helping to increase scientific understanding, better techniques have been developed to quickly characterize the earthquake and numerically model the tsunami. In 2014, the PTWC implemented Enhanced Products for the PTWS that now include wave amplitude forecasts in both text and graphical formats, and that require each country to explicitly assign Warning / Watch status in their own messages to their coasts. In July 2015, the First Pacific Ministerial Meeting on Meteorology adopted the Nuku'alofa Declaration, calling for support to ensure that National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHS) have the necessary capacity to support sustainable development, and specifically for the need to strengthen their tsunami early warning systems. Accordingly, the goal of this training is to increase the capacity of first responder operational staff to efficiently and effectively respond to tsunamis." ;

This activity is open to participants from Anguilla (UK), Dominica, Honduras, Jamaica, Montserrat (UK), Panama, Sint Maarten (Kingdom of Netherlands), St Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname and Turks and Caicos (UK), officially nominated by their Tsunami National Contacts (TNCs), thanks to the contribution of the Government of Monaco.  Currently over 70 sea level stations in the Caribbean and Adjacent Regions are contributing to the CARIBE EWS and are available to the Tsunami Service Providers and National Tsunami Warning Centres. In addition to fulfilling the requirements of tsunami services it is encouraged that the stations also meet the requirements of the Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS). The aim of this training course is to cover tide gauge technologies, practical levelling training (using the new St Lucia gauge), sea level variability (including tides and tsunamis) and an introduction to quality control/tidal analysis. The trainers from NOC will be Prof. Phil Woodworth, Dr. Francisco Calafat and Dr. Angela Hibert. It is expected that all participants will also present a written and oral report on the status of sea level operations of their institution.    " ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "Operational oceanography involves reliable, long term observations of the world's oceans and coastal waters, rapid interpretation and dissemination of data and generation of products and advisories that can be distributed to users in near real time. The recent advances made in observational technologies in the fields of sensors, platforms and real-time communications now provide capability to observe the oceans in detail. The winter school will focus on two aspects: Indian Ocean Circulation and Sea Level Variation. In recent years, the Indian Ocean (IO) has been discovered to have large impact on climate variability. Indian Ocean circulation vary differently in several respects from Pacific and Atlantic Ocean. The most striking difference is the seasonal reversal of the monsoon winds and its effects on the ocean currents in the Indian Ocean. Sea levels can be affected by many factors and are known to have varied greatly over geological time scales. The careful measurement of variations in Mean Sea Level can offer insights into ongoing climate change, and sea level rise has been widely quoted as evidence of ongoing global warming. With advancement in research and technology, ocean models are capable of providing prediction of ocean state in terms of circulation and hydrography. In recent years, data assimilation methods have been developed and used in many research areas. The first application of data assimilation techniques were in meteorology and today it is a key component of numerical weather forecasts. Data assimilation improves the estimate of the ocean and atmosphere physical state by combining the data from measurements and from dynamic models in an optimal way.    The winter school is jointly organized and sponsored by International Training Centre for Operational Oceanography (ITCOocean), ESSO - Indian National Centre for Ocean Information Services (INCOIS), India, Nansen Scientific Society and Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Centre (NERSC), Bergen, Norway and Nansen Environmental Research Centre India (NERCI), Kochi, India.     The winter school will cover monsoon variability at intra-seasonal and inter-annual time scale and its impact on Indian Ocean Circulation, Operational Indian Ocean Circulation and Modelling, Data Assimilation for ocean forecasting, The Nansen-TOPAZ modelling system, Physics of sea level variations and Indian Ocean sea level variation. The detailed Program of the Winter School is available at http://www.incois.gov.in/ITCOocean/pdfviewer.jsp?docname=/ITC003/ITC003_ProgramSchedule.pdf" ;

    <https://schema.org/description> "Within the framework of the Intergovernmental Coordination Group for the Tsunami and Other Coastal Hazards Warning System for the Caribbean and Adjacent Regions (ICG/CARIBE-EWS), the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO, the Puerto Rico Seismic Network (PRSN) of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez (UPRM) and the Caribbean Tsunami Warning Program (US NOAA/NWS) are organizing the “Fourth Training Course for Operators of Sea Level Stations in the Caribbean and Adjacent Regions”, in Mayagüez, Puerto Rico, 3–7 November 2014.  Currently over 60 sea level stations in the Caribbean and Adjacent Regions are contributing to the CARIBE EWS and are available to the existing Tsunami Warning Centres.  In addition to fulfilling the requirements of tsunami services it is encouraged that the stations also meet the requirements of the Global Sea Level Observing System (GLOSS). The aim of this training course is to facilitate the sustainability of this observational system. The course has two main components: the first focusing on the installation and operation of the stations and the second on the quality control, archival and analysis of the sea level data. It is expected that all participants will also present a written and oral report on the status of sea level operations of their institution.   " ;
