    "description": "GLD (Glider Data) dataset observed from glider measurement. The dataset has been recovered at region between 80°E – 160°E and 20°N-20°S including Indonesia water from any national and international research institute who conduct research survey at this region. This dataset consists several parameters including temperature, salinity, oxygen and chlorophyll. InaNODC has reformat the data and found that has more than 221.685 stations data and more than 44.981.128 samples data from June 1st, 2010. It was identified that several countries involved including Australia and United States had made observations using glider measurement.",
