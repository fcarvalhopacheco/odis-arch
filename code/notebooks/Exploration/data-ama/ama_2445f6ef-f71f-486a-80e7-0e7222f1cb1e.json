    "description": "This subset of GEBCO has been extracted for the Angola area of interest, GEBCO provides global bathymetry datasets for the world's oceans. The Centenary Edition of the GEBCO Digital Atlas, was published by British Oceanographic Data Centre (BODC) in April 2003 to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the initiation of the GEBCO Chart series. This release includes new bathymetric compilations for the Arctic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, the northeast and central-eastern Atlantic, the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico, the Weddell Sea and the waters around New Zealand. The Centenary Edition GDA includes the first release of the GEBCO One Minute Grid, providing bathymetry data on a one minute interval global grid. GEBCO published by the BODC on behalf of the Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of UNESCO and the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO).",
