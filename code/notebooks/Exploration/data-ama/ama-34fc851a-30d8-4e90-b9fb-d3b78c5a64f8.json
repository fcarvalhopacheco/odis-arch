    "description": "Dorob National Park was proclaimed in 2010.\nThese shapefiles were created using government gazettes. Where possible, boundaries were created from co-ordinates provided in the gazettes. Where landmarks were not specific co-ordinates, other shapefiles were used (e.g. farms shapefile, rivers shapefile, 1:250 000 maps etc.).",
