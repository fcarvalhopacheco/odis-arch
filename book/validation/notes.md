#  Notes

## About

Some points to address in the application guidance

```
distribution.url should override the Dataset @id
however, when distribution.url not avilable, use Dataset @id

this is more a situation in SPARQL space

```


## Prov

```
Gleaner prov defers to data graph prov.   Need guidance on the 
data graph prov
```

Need to define what I need from the resource data graph that I 
obtain from the prov now.   Review the existing SPARQL and 
see if the prov elements align with how we might make prov
in a schema.org pattern.  Then see how closely I can align that
to a provO pattern.  

Thoughts:

* use provo in json-ld graph
* align provo to schema elements in context header



## Cross linking

How to cross link between things like orgs referenced by datasets.

Examples being OBIS links to OE orgs.  


## Type hiearcy

address type hoerarchy for type in graphs...
