# Notes

* Move the geospatial geometry to under Coverage -> Place
* Make a Core 0 as Dataset
* note license pattern
* how to define a "cross archive" action
* Need PROV for "Person" as export, connect Person to the group publishing the info as MemberOf
* SOSO reference for time interval:  https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/Dataset.md#geologic-time 

This is the start of the EOV and related variables section.  At present this is just notes.

To comment on the graph:
* Each EOV dataset MUST have the following components to be considered complete:
* A qualified link to the DOI of the method used to generate that dataset
* A qualified link to a DOI of the QA/QC processes and principles used on that dataset
* A qualified link to to the GOOS EOV specification sheet the EOV is supposed to align to
* A qualified link/element that points to the variables/elements in that dataset that is the EOV (if it's a complex dataset)
  * That element should have a propertyID to an ontology term (from an ontology that can be interpreted by GOOS/IODE) that identifies which EOV it is
* A qualified link to the measurement event(s)
  * that can link onward to the measurement devices used
* A qualified link to the spatial coverage of the data (can be placenames, but better if actual geospatial content like WKT)
* A qualified link to some sort of temporal metadata that SoSo is attempting to settle a pattern for

## Need to:

* Review [PropertyValue](https://schema.org/PropertyValue) vs [DefinedTerm](https://schema.org/DefinedTerm) and they could connect with [variableMeasured](https://schema.org/variableMeasured)
