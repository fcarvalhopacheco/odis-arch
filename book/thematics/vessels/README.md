# Vessels

## About

OIH is exploring how we might leverage schema.org to describe research vessels.  
Note that schema.org is a very broad vocabulary and as such specific concepts 
like research vessel is not well aligned.

In Schema.org the type [Vehicle](https://schema.org/Vehicle) is described as a device that is designed 
or used to transport people or cargo over land, water, air, or through space.
We have used this broad scoping to cover research vessels.  We could go on to 
connect this type then to a descriptive property in a concept such at 
the WikiData entry for [Research Vessel, Q391022](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q391022).
We may wish to leverage some of the approaches in [Keywords and Defined Terms](../terms/list.md).


Our goal is to use schema.org as a simple upper level vocabulary that allows
us to describe research vessels in a simple and then connect off to more 
detailed information on them.  

So the goal here is to show how we can use schema.org as a discovery layer
and link more directly to detailed institutional metadata records.  


```{literalinclude} ./graphs/ship.json
:linenos:
```


```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-input]

import json
from pyld import jsonld
import os, sys

currentdir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(''))
parentdir = os.path.dirname(currentdir)
sys.path.insert(0, parentdir)
from lib import jbutils

with open("./graphs/ship.json") as dgraph:
    doc = json.load(dgraph)

context = {
    "@vocab": "https://schema.org/",
}

compacted = jsonld.compact(doc, context)
jbutils.show_graph(compacted)

```


### Details: Indentifier

For each profile there are a few key elements we need to know about.  One
key element is what the authoritative reference or canonical identifier is for 
a resource.  

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-input]

import json
from rdflib.extras.external_graph_libs import rdflib_to_networkx_multidigraph
from rdflib.extras.external_graph_libs import rdflib_to_networkx_graph
from pyld import jsonld
import graphviz
import os, sys

currentdir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(''))
parentdir = os.path.dirname(currentdir)
sys.path.insert(0, parentdir)
from lib import jbutils

with open("./graphs/ship.json") as dgraph:
    doc = json.load(dgraph)

frame = {
  "@context": {"@vocab": "https://schema.org/"},
  "@explicit": "true",
  "@requireAll": "true",
  "@type":     "Vehicle",
  "identifier": ""
}

context = {
    "@vocab": "https://schema.org/",
}

compacted = jsonld.compact(doc, context)

framed = jsonld.frame(compacted, frame)
jd = json.dumps(framed, indent=4)
print(jd)

jbutils.show_graph(framed)

```

### Details: subjectOf

Like SOS, we are recommending the use of subjectOf to link a simple 
Schema.org type to a more detailed metadata description record.  This 
allows us to use the easy discovery layer in Schema.org but connect to 
domain specific metadata records. 

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-input]

import json
from rdflib.extras.external_graph_libs import rdflib_to_networkx_multidigraph
from rdflib.extras.external_graph_libs import rdflib_to_networkx_graph
from pyld import jsonld
import graphviz
import os, sys

currentdir = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(''))
parentdir = os.path.dirname(currentdir)
sys.path.insert(0, parentdir)
from lib import jbutils

with open("./graphs/ship.json") as dgraph:
    doc = json.load(dgraph)

frame = {
  "@context": {"@vocab": "https://schema.org/"},
  "@explicit": "true",
  "@requireAll": "true",
  "@type":     "Vehicle",
  "subjectOf": ""
}

context = {
    "@vocab": "https://schema.org/",
}

compacted = jsonld.compact(doc, context)

framed = jsonld.frame(compacted, frame)
jd = json.dumps(framed, indent=4)
print(jd)

jbutils.show_graph(framed)

```
