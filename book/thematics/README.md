# Thematic Patterns

## Introduction

These thematic patterns are managed by OIH and the community to add in the discovery and use 
of ocean related resources.  The patterns are simple examples of Schema.org types, with a focus
on the properties and type relations of value to the Ocean InfoHub and the community it engages. 

These "profiles" provide both a starting point for new users and a catalysis for discussion and 
extension with the community. 

## Thematic Profiles

These profiles represent reference implementation of schema.org Types related to the 
identified ODIS thematic areas.  They provide a set of minimal elements and notes on more detailed elements.  

These are not final and will evolve with community input.  As this process moves forward we will implement
versioning the profiles to provide stable implementations providers can reliably leverage in their workflows.

5. [Vessels](./vessels/README.md)

In support of these five thematic types above, these cross cutting types and properties were 
selected for attention.  They represent some key patterns people may wish to leverage when 
describing their resources.

For OIH the focus is on generic documents which can scope reports, data and other resources.
In those cases where the resources being described are of type Dataset you may wish to review
patterns developed for GeoScience Datasets by the ESIP
[Science on Schema](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/) community.

For OIH the focus is on generic documents which can scope reports, data and other resources.
In those cases where the resources being described are life sciences resources such as datasets, software, and training materials. we recommend following 
patterns developed by [Bioschemas](https://bioschemas.org/).

## Example Connections

The following figure provides an overview of potential connections between the 
various thematic types in OIH.  These are not _all_ the relations but simply 
some to demonstrate the concept as well as give some guidance on the 
connection of value in query results.
