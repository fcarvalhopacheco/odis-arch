# OIH Notebooks

## About

Notebooks related to the OIH project.  These are early documents and they and 
this documentation will expand.  These notebooks are developed and run using 
the Jupyter Data Science notebooks server (https://hub.docker.com/r/jupyter/datascience-notebook).  The will likely run on Google Colab or Binder but additional installs
may be required.   We will attempt to document all requirements in the notebooks.
