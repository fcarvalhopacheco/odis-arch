Authoring Thematic Patterns
The ODIS OIH is working across five major thematic areas; Experts and Institutions, Documents, Projects, Training, Vessels. Examples of these thematic concepts are being hosted and developed with input from the community. Additionally, methods for validation and simple tooling for authoring and testing are hosted at this repository. Alongside these five thematic topics guidance on connecting services and spatial context on resources.

Publishing
Guidance on implementation the web architecture approach is also available. This includes approaches on leveraging robots.txt and sitemaps.xml file for expressing hosted resources to the net.

Indexing
The architecture approach is open and standards based. As such, many organizations will be able to leverage the authoring and publishing approaches above to index a providers resources. OIH will be providing reference implementations of software that can generate the index.

Interfaces and Services
During the development of the OIH a basic reference implementation for an interface has been generated. This is a development site meant to test and exercise the above elements. It serves to demonstrate how others could also implement this approach and how future interfaces could be developed.
