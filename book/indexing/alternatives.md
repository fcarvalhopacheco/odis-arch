# Alternatives

## Options

While [Gleaner](https://gleaner.io/) will be used during initial OIH development it is not
the only approach.   There are many other tools that
can be used and might be leveraged in a production environment including:

* [Extrunct](https://github.com/scrapinghub/extruct)
* [LDSpider](https://github.com/ldspider/ldspider)
* [Squirrel](https://dice-group.github.io/squirrel.github.io/overview.html)
* [Nutch (Apache)](http://nutch.apache.org/)
* [Laundromat](https://github.com/LOD-Laundromat/LOD-Laundromat)
* [DataArchiver](https://github.com/websi96/datasetarchiver)
* [OD Archiver](https://archiver.ai.wu.ac.at/)
* [BioSchemas](https://bioschemas.org/software/)

These different tools may better fit into the workflow and available
skill sets for a group.
