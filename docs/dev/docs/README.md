## Notes


Thematic section on documents and best practices.  

This would scope:

* services that allow searching on these stores
* The documents themselves
* perhaps just the repository itself
* when we talk DC..  are we talking DC in JSON-LD or mapped to schema.org

Could use Org -> provides service

### Refs

* For dataset we can use [SOS Dataset](https://github.com/ESIPFed/science-on-schema.org/blob/master/guides/Dataset.md)
* OBPS group is using JericoS3 API (ref:  https://www.jerico-ri.eu/)
  * Traditional knowledge points here
  * sounds like they use dspace  
* For other document these are likely going to be some [schema:CretiveWork](https://schema.org/CreativeWork) with there being many subtypes we can explore.   See also here Adam Leadbetter's work at [Ocean best practices](https://github.com/adamml/ocean-best-practices-on-schema)
  * This is a great start and perhaps helps to highlight why SHACL shapes are useful
  * https://irishmarineinstitute.github.io/erddap-lint/ 
  * https://github.com/earthcubearchitecture-project418/p419dcatservices/blob/master/CHORDS/DataFeed.jsonld
*[EMODnet](https://emodnet.eu/en)  (Coner Delaney)
  * ERDAP also
  * Are we talking links from schema.org that link to OGC and ERDAP services 
  * Are these methods?  
  * Sounds like may link to external metadata for interop they have developed in the community
* NOAA connected as well
  * Interested in OGC assets  
  * ERDAP data platform




### SDG Linking

#### Refs

* [SDGs](http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/SDGIO?iri=http://purl.unep.org/sdg/SDGIO_00000000_)
* [SDG targets](http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/SDGIO?iri=http://purl.unep.org/sdg/SDGIO_00000001)
* [SDG indicators](http://www.ontobee.org/ontology/SDGIO?iri=http%3A%2F%2Fpurl.unep.org%2Fsdg%2FSDGIO_00000003)



Note, how would we do a link to a SDG (sustainable development goal)?
We could use [subjectOf](https://schema.org/subjectOf) like SOS did
for metadata below.  

```json
{
    "@context": "https://schema.org/",
    "@type": "Dataset",
    "name": "Removal of organic carbon by natural bacterioplankton communities as a function of pCO2 from laboratory experiments between 2012 and 2016",
    "distribution": {
      "@type": "DataDownload",
      ...
    },
    "subjectOf": {
      "@type": "DataDownload",
      "name": "eml-metadata.xml",
      "description": "EML metadata describing the dataset",
      "encodingFormat": ["application/xml", "https://eml.ecoinformatics.org/eml-2.2.0"],
      "dateModified":"2019-06-12T14:44:15Z"
    }
  }
  ```
