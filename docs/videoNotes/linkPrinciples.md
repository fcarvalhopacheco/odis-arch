The publishingPrinciples property indicates 
(typically via URL) a document
describing the editorial principles of 
an Organization (or individual e.g. a 
Person writing a blog) that relate to their
 activities as a publisher, e.g. 
ethics or diversity policies. When applied to
 a CreativeWork (e.g. NewsArticle) 
the principles are those of the party 
primarilyresponsible for the creation of the CreativeWork.
While such policies are most typically expressed 
in natural language, 
sometimes related information (e.g. indicating 
a funder) can be expressed
using schema.org terminology.
