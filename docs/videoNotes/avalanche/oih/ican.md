# General Concepts

Schema.org and structured data on the web patterns are NOT a spatial database but
can carry spatial information and connect it to other resources

Aids discovery, but also a means to alignment and connections (can leverage
unique and persistent ID use)

Gateway to enhanced web presence and indexing by commercial (Google et al)  and community indexes like OIH

Both distributed and federated and also based on web standards and recommendation like 
[Spatial On the Web Best Practices](https://www.w3.org/TR/sdw-bp/)

# Map as Creative Work

* In schema.org, a map is a CreativeWork, not a spatial geometry  

* Would be used to reference documents (KML, GeoPackage, GeoJSON, PDFs,  etc)

See Also a special case of connecting concepts to spatial regions: [Marine Regions link example](https://github.com/iodepo/odis-arch/blob/schema-dev/book/thematics/spatial/graphs/gazetteer.json).  This shows connections to a [Marine Regions resource](http://www.marineregions.org/eezdetails.php?mrgid=48957) and [WikiData example](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q16635).
