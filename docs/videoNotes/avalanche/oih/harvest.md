# Conclusion

Using these approaches you could explore data from other sources you know are publishing JSON-LD. You could improve either of the bash script or Python code to loop on the resources and store the results in files or load them directly into a triples store / graph database.

As we continue, we will move on to the Gleaner package that is used by Ocean InfoHub and see some of the edge cases that can be addressed with it and how it fits into a more automated process.
