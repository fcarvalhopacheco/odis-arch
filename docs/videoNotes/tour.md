## Prerequisets 

Understand concept of schema.org and the OIH types and the basics of JSON-LD

## Foundation Document

We will start with a core foundation document.  This can 
be found at: https://book.oceaninfohub.org/foundation/foundation.html

## Thematic type needs

Starting from our foundation document we will convert the type to the 
schema.org type associated with our thematic.  

* Mention the concept of required, recommended, enhancing (never final)
* Talk about the type here and introduce some OIH elements for that type
    * note that nothing is required and adding and removing doesn't break things.  

Close with mentionign that nothing is really required only, recommended.
These are focused on end use mostly and emerging use cases

The emerging nature is import since these are living profiles that 
benefit from the community sharing use cases for the graph that extend or 
perhap even prune and change aspects of the thematic types.
