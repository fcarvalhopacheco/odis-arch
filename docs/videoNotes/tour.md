## Prerequisets 

Understand concept of schema.org and the OIH types and the basics of JSON-LD

## Foundation Document

has:
- context and body (graph)
- @id
- @type
- name
- description

Have a simple basic JSON-LD document open and use that 
to present the idea of context, @id and @type.

## Themtic type needs

* Introduce the type we will discuss, it's goal and it in schema.org web site again
* (Re)introduce the concept of: required, recommended, enhancing (never final)
* Talk about the type here and introduce some OIH elements for that type
    * note that nothing is required and adding and removing doesn't break things.  

1) a base example document (from the book example)
2) make some edits and drop into JSON-LD playground or linter
