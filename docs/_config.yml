description: The IOC Ocean InfoHub Project (OIH) is a new initiative to streamline access to ocean science data and information for management and sustainable development. The OIH will establish and anchor a network of regional and thematic nodes that will improve online access to and synthesis of existing global, regional and national data, information and knowledge resources. The project will center on an openly accessible web platform designed to support interlinkages and interoperability between distributed resources including existing clearinghouse mechanisms.
