# Authoring

## About

For many groups working with JSON will already be part of the
various pipelines they have.  For others, this will be new.

This document will evolve to hold resources for people at various
levels to author with JSON-LD data graphs.

Primarily, this will be used to either create a single unique JSON-LD 
based graph for a resource or to explore an approach you might use as
a template in code.

Note, many common publishing tools already have schema.org support in 
them that leverages the package metadata data model.  We are compiling
a list of those too.
