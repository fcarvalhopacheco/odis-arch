# README

## About

Documentation on implementing schema.org for the Ocean Info Hub (OIH) to facilitate the indexing and discovery
of resources.  The approach leverages schema.org which is a community effort and widely
implemented.

## Thematic Profiles

These profiles represent reference implementation of schema.org Types related to the identified ODIS thematic areas.  
They provide a set of minimal elements and notes on more detailed elements.  

These are not final and will evolve with community input.  As this process moves forward we will implement
versioning the profiles to provide stable implementations providers can reliably leverage in their workflows.

## Publishing and Indexing Notes

The stages of the data flow include the authoring, publishing and harvesting or indexing of the published resources. The following sections break these out and provide guidance.

* [Publishing](./docs/publishing.md):  Notes for leveraging the web architecture to publish and expose your described resources.
* [Indexing](./docs/indexers.md): How to building indexes from information published following structured data on the web practices.  The approaches used by OIH can be leveraged both by commercial indexing services as well as community managed resources.
