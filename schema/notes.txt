# Notes

## About

These notes are based on OIH meetings.  Out of context they are likely of little use. 

## Notes

### Documents

* For "Docs" focus on base CreativeWork type
* do a schema.org/Map example
* How can we leverage the "auto" work in schema.org for vessels
* DKAN and  CKAN are popular to exploring how to help people leverage 
those in OIH patterns is important
* Need a notebook to maintain and inspect the sources sitemaps and 
provide an assessment approach for the various parties. 
* Explore leveraging WikiData linkage with geo -> Place(WikiData) for 
example for things like "Gulf of Mexico"
* Project
    * Add: diversity, hasCredentials, parent org, tax ID, 
    vat ID, potentialAction, funding source, knowsAbout, areaServed, ethicsPolicy

### Indexing

* Need to ensure a provenance for the graph documents collected.
This will be both the object URN in the object store.  It will 
also be something like a nanopub prov.

## EU

Peter (SeaDataNet)

Kevin:  erdap needs to be leveraged (which is good since it support schema.org well)
CF conventions (netcdf format)   attributes for dataset discovery (in netcdf?)
darwin core (for bio)  (bioschemas.org)
Kevin is working on netcdf profiles

Addressing ambiguity in the graphs (shacl, json-ld parsing, https hell)

Sandra (eurocean):
use seadata cloud (work to match to standards (which ones?))

Julie & Conner (EMODnet):
Inspire standards (metadata and interop)

Is there an OAI-PMH to schame.org graph mapping / tool
