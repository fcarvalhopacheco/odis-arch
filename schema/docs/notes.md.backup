Wanted to provide a brief update on the three meetings held this week.



Meeting 1
Sioeli Tonga
Domain:
Example URL
Software used: CKAN framework


In contact with CKAN developers.  

Looking at ckanext-dcat and sitemap extension to CKAN and will set up 
a test.  Will touch base again in 1 week.  (will set up that meeting)



Meeting 2 
Tavita
Domain:
Example URL:
Software used: DCAN


Not moving to DCAN2 which does look to support the approach due to needs related to 
data and user management in DCAN but not in DCAN2.  They are also migrating 
at this time from Drupal 7 to Drupal 9 and also reviewing their metadata
schema (sounds like in communication with Sioeli on this).  

Will review the JSON-LD plugin jsonld-schema for use in Drupal and 
set up a test site. 


Meeting 3
Tim Tkint
Domain:
Example URL: https://www.marinetraining.eu/node/4079
Sitemap: https://www.marinetraining.eu/sitemap.xml
Software used:  didn't come up


Reviewed and made a few updates to the JSON-LD.  Almost ready to index (next week 
as a target for that).  Need to address a few things for him (not blocks to 
indexing).  These include: approaches for authoritative declares in the document.  
This speaks to the larger point of addressing identifying and working with duplicate
records.

BONUS Meeting 4
Arno
Domain:  AquaDocs
Example

This is an interesting use case that may not be all that un-common (not sure).   
This is the case of it's easier to generate the graph vs modify the web site.  
Approach, provide a graph distribution (recommend Data Objects package approach)
